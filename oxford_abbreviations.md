# Style rules for common abbreviations

[From *New Hart's Rules*/*Oxford Style Manual*]

<!-- page 182 -->

## `e.g.`, `i.e.`, `viz.`

1. Do not confuse 'e.g.' (from Latin *exempli gratia*), meaning 'for example', with 'i.e.'
(Latin *id est*), meaning 'that is'. Compare `hand tools, e.g. hammer and screwdriver` with `hand
tools, i.e. those able to be held in the user's hands`.

2. Write 'e.g.' and 'i.e.' in lower-case roman, with two points and no spaces. **Oxford style does
not use a comma after i.e. and e.g. to avoid double punctuation**

3. A comma, colon, or dash should precede 'e.g.' and 'i.e.'

    * A comma is generally used when there is no verb in the following phrase:  

        - `different fruits, e.g. apples, oranges, bananas, and cherries`  
        - `part of a printed document, e.g. a book cover`
    
    * Use a colon or **dash before a clause or a long list**:  

        - `digital cameras have the advantage of being solid-state devices—i.e. they don't have
          moving parts`

4. A sentence in text cannot begin with 'e.g.' or 'i.e.'; however, a note can, in which case they
remain lower case.

5. Take care to distinguish 'i.e.' from the rarer 'viz.' (Latin *videlicet*, 'namely'). Formerly
some writers used 'i.e.' to supply a definition or paraphrase, and 'viz.' to introduce a list of
items. However, **it is Oxford's preference either to replace 'viz.' with 'namely' or to
prefer 'i.e.' in every case**.

6. Although many people employ 'e.g.' and 'i.e.' quite naturally in speech as well as writing,
prefer 'for example', 'such as' (or, more informally, 'like'), and 'that is' in running text.
Conversely, adopt 'e.g.' and 'i.e.' within parentheses or notes, since abbreviations are preferred
there.

## `etc.`

1. In full 'etc.' is *et cetera*, a Latin phrase meaning 'and other things'. 'Et al.' is short for
  Latin *et alii*, 'and others'. In general contexts both are lower-case roman, with a full point,
  though 'et al.' is sometimes italicized in bibliographic use. 

2. 'Etc.' is preceded by a comma if it follows more than one listed item: `robins, sparrows, etc.`.

    * It is best to avoid using 'etc.' after only one item (`robins etc.`), as at least two examples
      are necessary to establish the relationship between the elements and show how the list might
      go on. 

3. The full point can be followed by a comma or whatever other punctuation would be required after
an equivalent phrase such as *and the like—* but not by a second full point, to avoid double
punctuation.

4. Use 'etc.' in technical or scholarly contexts such as notes and works of reference. Elsewhere,
prefer *such as*, *like*, or *for example* before a list, or *and so on*, *and the like* after it;
none of these can be used in combination with 'etc.'

5. It is considered rude to use 'etc.' when listing individual people; use 'and others' instead;
use 'etc.' when listing *types* of people, however. In a technical context, such as a bibliography,
use 'et al.'

    * Individual people: `Daisy, Katie, Alexander, and others`
    * Types of people: `duke, marquess, earl, etc.` 
    * In a technical context: `Smith, Jones, Brown, et al.`

6. Do not write 'and etc.': 'etc.' includes the meaning of 'and'. 

7. Do not end a list with 'etc.' if it begins with 'e.g.', 'including', 'for example', or 'such as',
since these indicate that the list is to be incomplete. Choose one or the other, not both.
