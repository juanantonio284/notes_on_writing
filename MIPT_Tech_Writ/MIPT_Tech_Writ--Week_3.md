# Week 3, Lesson 4: Visuals and Technicalities

## Visuals

Visuals communicate a large amount of information quickly and efficiently.

* When you are designing visuals, be sure to include only information that directly relates to the
  mechanism description and is specifically keyed to the description provided in the text

* Do not include visuals that do not match the mechanism description in subject matter or
  terminology

* Avoid visuals that include too much or too little complexity for the level of discussion in the
  paper, these are general guidelines for using visuals

* Include visuals in a technical paper only when you have a reason to do so (if you do not know why
  you're putting a visual into your paper, you probably do not need it)

* Reference a visual in the text discussion **prior** to its placement in the report (if the visual
  precedes its reference the reader will wonder why is it there, be sure to number and title all
  visuals)

* Ensure all visuals directly clarify, or otherwise enhance, the text discussion. You need to
  integrate them into your report, not just stick them somewhere. That, ultimately, means
  that **the labels and the captions used in the visual should match the text descriptions**. For
  example, if you're describing the negative terminal of a diode, do not call "the negative
  terminal" in the text and "the cathode" in the visual

* Document your visuals when they contain copyrighted information or represent borrowed ideas
  because visuals often get separated from the report. Do not rely solely on notational or
  parenthetical documentation, include the source line with the visual itself, usually, under the
  visual's number or title

### When designing your visuals, keep in mind:

**Reproducibility**: design your visuals with the output process of your report in mind
 
* If your report will be printed or duplicated in a single color link, or toner, consider the fact
  when you are developing graphs or diagrams. Be especially wary of different colors that may look
  great on your video display, but could print with exactly the same shades of grey or even blend
  into the color of the paper on which the report is printed. A safe approach is to use pattern
  fields instead of color when the reports will be printed or duplicated in a single color

**Simplicity**: remember that the purpose of visuals is to supplement and clarify the information
  you are presenting

* Some concepts are so complex that they do not lend themselves to visual presentation, other
  concepts may need to be broken down into smaller components for effective presentation

**Accuracy**: ensure that any visual you use accurately represents the information

  * Do not exaggerate the by manipulating scales or misinterpreting relative sizes

### Types of visuals and their purpose:

* Equations and formulas in mathematics: symbolic expressions that represent a rule, statement,
  principle or a relation between two expressions

* Formulas in chemistry: symbolic representations of atoms, molecules and/or different chemical
  reactions

* Diagrams: drawings that show a mechanism or its components

* Graphs: drawings that display and represent sets of numbers, values, quantities or proportions

* Schematics: visual representations of the structure of a mechanism or process

* Tables: columns and rows that display the orderly arrangement of data

* Images and photographs: provide accurate visual reproductions

## Technical definition

In technical writing, a **definition** is the process by which one assigns a precise meaning to a
term. To define a term, it must be placed into classification and then differentiated from other
terms in that same classification.

**The format for technical definition** is straightforward and works like this: 
`Term = Classification + Differentiation`.

For example, if a writer were to define *the stall condition that an airplane experiences when it
loses lift*, he or she could start with the term (`stall`), followed by a classification
(`flight condition`), and then differentiate it from all other flight conditions.

The definition might be something like this: `A stall is a flight condition in which the lift
produced becomes less than the weight of the airplane and the airplane stops flying.`

————————————
<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈ 12 character line (EM Rule —) ≈≈≈≈ -->

That sounds simple enough. But what happens when a term such as *stall* has multiple definitions in
many contexts? In such cases, it may be necessary to add a qualifier in front of its definition
statement to supply the necessary context. The qualifier is important when the general context for
a definition needs to be established upfront. If the context is known, or is obvious, a qualifier
isn't necessary. For example, in an aeronautics study on aircraft wing design, the context
of *stall* is obvious. It is clear that *stall*, in this case, has more to do with the loss of lift
than with, say, a defensive maneuver employed by a baseball team to slow down the pace of the
game.

**When a context is needed, the format for the definition is this**:  
`Classification = Differentiation = Qualifier + Term`.

For example, below we have three definitions of the same term in different contexts:

* `CAR (In driving), a stall is an operating condition in which a sudden and unexpected loss of
  power occurs.`

* `AIRPLANE (In flying) a stall is a flight condition in which the lift produced is less than the
  weight of the airplane.`

* `COW (In farming), a stall is a single, three-sided compartment that is designed to shelter an
  animal in a barn or stable.`

In the first example: '`CAR (In driving)`' is the qualifier; '`stall`' is the term; '`is an
operating condition in which a sudden and unexpected loss of power occurs`' is the classification.

### The class

Often, the most difficult part of writing a technical definition lies in determining the proper
classification for the term. The class should be a general category in which the term fits, but it
cannot be too general. Consider the sentence below.

"`The 33-kiloohm, 1-watt carbon resistor is a device that impedes the flow of electric current.`"

The problem with this classification is that 'device' could mean all kinds of different things, most
of which have nothing to do with circuit or circuit components. That is why using this term does
not really help specify the meaning of the term. By changing 'device' to 'circuit component',
however, the meaning can be narrowed considerably for the reader, even before the classification is
*differentiated*.

**Differentiation** involves narrowing the meaning of the term to just one possibility within the 
class.

Clearly, it would be easier to narrow the class of 'circuit components' to a particular resistor,
than it would be to narrow the class of 'device' to a particular resistor—there are all kinds of
devices in the world but relatively few circuit components. 

The class 'circuit components', however, still contains many possibilities: capacitors, diodes,
switches, potentiometers, inductors, transistors and IC chips, etc. In this case, a good approach
is to focus on the function of a resistor, which is to impede the flow of electric current, and to
use that function to differentiate the class. Then we have the following definition:

"`The 33-kiloohm, 1-watt carbon resistor is a circuit component that impedes the flow of electric
 current.`"

You must always consider the reader's knowledge and skill level when defining terms and concepts.
However, at times, you may have no choice but to violate the principle to achieve your goal.
Sometimes, a simple term or concept that the audience will understand is just not available. In
fact, sometimes the only thing to do is to define the term as best as you can, and then add
extensions to your definition to clarify the meaning.

### Extensions

There are many types of *extensions* of an original definition; below are the most common.
(The original definition is included in brackets followed by the extension.)

1. **Further definition** is used to further define terms from an original definition.

```

[In water softening, zeolite is an exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium
and magnesium ions.] Zeolite is a collection of small polystyrene beads that forms a resin carrying
a negative charge.

```

2. **Comparison and contrast** is used to show differences or similarities.

```

[In water softening, zeolite is an exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium
and magnesium ions.] Zeolite collects calcium and magnesium ions in the same way a feather broom
collects dust.

```

3. **Classification** is used to organize information into categories.

```

[In water softening, zeolite is an exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium
and magnesium ions.] Zeolite is used for ion-exchange home water softening, while lime and soda ash
are used in precipitating municipal water softeners.

```

4. **Cause and effect** is used to demonstrate why something happens (or used when results need to
be traced). 

```

[In water softening, zeolite is exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium and
magnesium ions.] Zeolite carries a negative charge and attracts the positively charged calcium and
magnesium ions in water.

```

5. **Process** is used to list the steps of a procedure.

```

[In water softening, zeolite is an exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium
and magnesium ions.] First, the zeolite is charged with sodium ions from a salt brine solution in
the regeneration step. Once charged, the zeolite absorbs calcium and magnesium ions from passing
hard water while releasing sodium ions into the resulting soft water.

```

6. **Exemplification** is used to give real or analogous examples.

```

[In water softening, zeolite is an exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium
and magnesium ions.] Examples of the zeolite group include analcimes, chabazites, and gismondines.

```

7. **Etymology** is used to show the linguistic genesis of the term.

```

[In water softening, zeolite is an exchange resin that releases sodium ions while gaining calcium
and magnesium ions.] The term zeolite comes from the Greek words zeon, meaning to boil, and lithos,
meaning stone. It was first coined by the Swedish mineralogist Alex Fredrick Cronstedt in the 18th
century.

```

### Consider the audience

In some situations you may need to sacrifice desired precision in your definition to achieve the
desired level of communication; for example, it might not be a good idea to try to achieve expert
level precision with an uninformed audience. 

Consider the following two definitions of a black hole, the astrophysical phenomenon that is
supposed to exist somewhere in space.

**Definition 1**

> In astrophysics, a black hole is a set of events from which it wasn't possible to escape to a
  large distance. A black hole gets its name from its boundary, called an event horizon, which is
  formed by the paths in space-time of rays of light that just fail to get away, hovering instead
  forever on the edge. And, consequently, moving path parallel to and away from one another.

**Definition 2**

> In astrophysics, a black hole is a collapsed neutron star whose gravity is so great that even
  light can't escape. Although fusion reactions within this collapsed star still may emit brilliant
  rays of light, when it is viewed from the outside, the black hole appears to be a totally dark
  void in space.

*Definition 1* functions at the expert level for theoretical physicists; it provides a precise and
accurate description of a black hole, and thus is appropriate for their needs. But for the less
informed reader, it represents a mind twisting experience that in many cases can leave readers more
confused about the term, than they were before they read it.

*Definition 2* functions at the level of the average reader; it is not nearly as precise or accurate
as the first definition, but it communicates the basic gist of what constitutes a black hole in
space.

The problem is that, to be precisely correct and absolutely accurate, you would have to function at
a level where you cannot effectively communicate with the average reader. If you were writing for
average reader, you would have to make a decision here. Either be absolutely correct and
communicate less effectively, or be less than absolutely correct and communicate more effectively.
Since your goal is effective communication, your decision is obvious.

# Week 3, Lesson 5: Terminology

## Mechanism Description

Being able to describe mechanisms precisely and accurately and at a level and in a way that the
reader needs and can understand is perhaps the most essential skill of technical writing.

Mechanism description documents are built around precise descriptions of size, shape, color, finish,
texture, and material. And they can be written for a wide range of audience competencies. Very
often such documents include figures, diagrams, or photographs that help to clarify the worded
description.

### Model for a general description of a mechanism

1. Define using a technical definition.

2. Add extensions to discuss any theory or principle necessary for the reader to understand the
description.

Be careful here: think about what you are doing, for whom you are doing it, and why you are doing
it. Do not lose sight of the reader's knowledge and skill level, or forget the purpose of the
report. The goal is not to show how smart you are but rather to communicate the information. So
when you're discussing theory and mechanism description, a good rule is to do what is necessary but
only what is necessary. Always make sure you add only what the reader needs for the purpose at
hand. If the reader does not need any theory or operating principles, do not provide any.

3. Describe the overall function or purpose.

4. Describe the overall appearance (for example shape, color, material, finish, texture, mass,
weight, size).

5. List the parts in the order in which you to intend to describe them.

This listing is an organizational blueprint for the remainder of the mechanism description. In other
words, the decision regarding the order in which to list the mechanisms parts is not trivial, it
effectively determines the structure for the rest of the mechanism description.

There are two methods to order the parts, *functionally* and *spatially*.

* Using a functional approach, you can order the parts in terms of how the parts function with one
  another. Functionally, for example you could starts with the leads, which connect their circuits,
  the common element: "`The resistor consists of the following parts: two wire leads, the carbon
  element, the casting, and the color bands.`"[^note_1]

* Using a spatial organization, you can move from left to right, or top to bottom, or inside out,
  inside in. With an inside-out spatial approach, the example above might read this way: "`The
  resistor consists of the following parts: the carbon element, the wire leads, the casting, and
  the color bands.`"

Both approaches are fine, as long as they're logical and made sense to the reader.

[^note_1]: 
Recall the example in the previous lecture: "`the 33-kilohm, 1-watt carbon resistor is a device
that impedes the flow of electric current, which is protected by the casting and the round which
the carbon bands are painted to indicate resistance and tolerance values.`"

6. Provide a detailed description of **each part**.

  * (i) Define the first part with a technical definition, adding extensions as needed to deal with
    theory or operating principles
  * (ii) Describe the part's overall function or purpose
  * (iii) Describe the part's shape, color, material, finish, texture, and size. As well as any
    other physical attributes appropriate for the mechanism and its function using precise measures
    and descriptors

7. The final section of the mechanism description briefly summarizes the mechanism's function and
provides a sense of finality to the document.

Include a sentence that by tone and content indicates to the reader that the mechanism description
is complete: e.g. "`Together these parts form one of the most commonly used circuit components and
electric systems today.`"

This final sentence tells the reader not to look for anything else, because the document is ending.
It is a courtesy to the reader.

## Process descriptions

<!-- was the original title "Mechanism Operation"? -->

*Mechanism Descriptions* detail the physical attributes of a mechanism.

*Process Descriptions* are similar to *Mechanism Descriptions* in organizational structure but they
differ in content; they describe either the steps in the operation of a mechanism, or the steps of
a conceptual process.

Here is a model for a general description of a process:

1. Introduce the mechanism with a logical definition.
2. Add extensions to provide any needed theory or principles.
3. Describe the purpose, function, and operation of this mechanism.
4. List the major steps of the mechanism's operation in the order that they will be discussed. 
5. The final section of the process description briefly summarizes the process and provides a sense
of finality to the document.

### Example

**Description of the process of the operation of an air conditioning system.**

The audience for this description is a *general* technical reader who does not have specific
expertise in air conditioning fluid mechanisms or thermodynamics.

**1.** Introduce the mechanism with a logical definition.

**2.** Add extensions to provide any needed theory or principles.

```
"An air conditioner is a mechanical device used to refrigerate a controlled environment. The air
 conditioner accomplishes this refrigeration by transferring heat within the environment to an area
 outside the environment."
```

**3.** Describe the purpose, function, and operation of this mechanism.

```

"The air conditioner transfers heat by using a fluid refrigerant. This refrigerant is pumped through
 the controlled environment and the outside area. At the same time, the refrigerant is cycled at
 strategic points between liquid an vaporous states. This change in the state provides the means
 for transferring thermal energy."
```

  You may want to list the primary operational parts of the mechanism especially if they relay
  directly to the process steps. 

**4.** List the major steps of the mechanism's operation in the order that they will be discussed. 

Choosing this order may not be easy. Ideally, the steps will follow a logical timeline from the
start to the finish of the process. However, in some cases such as transactional, iterative, or
branching processes, that may not be possible. In such cases, you will have to describe the process
steps in the way that is that clearest to adhere and the purpose at hand. 

```
"The air conditioner's operation is centered on four major components: the compressor, condenser
 coil, expansion valve, and evaporator coil. The operation of the air conditioner relates directly
 to these parts and includes the following steps: compression, condensation, expansion, and
 evaporation."
```

Treat such steps as a separate subsection. Define each step of the process. Then extend those
definitions as necessary to address to the equipment, material or concepts involved. Be sure to
tell your reader clearly what happens in each step, and provide link and transitions between the
steps. 

————————————

*Subexample*: Discuss compression in reasonable depth for the audience and purpose at hand. First,
define compression and then deal with the equipment and concepts involved. Describe what happens
during the compression. And then show their relationship with the next step condensation. 

```
"Compression is a fluid-dynamics process in which a given volume of refrigerant vapor is forced to
 occupy a smaller volume of space. Compression occurs when the compressor forces hot refrigerant
 vapor under pressure into the compression chamber. The chamber is composed of a cylinder and valve
 arrangement. The pistol draws refrigerant into the cylinder through an intake valve, and the
 intake valve closes and the pistol pushes up into the cylinder, compressing the refrigerant vapor.
 The vapor then exits through an exhaust valve and enters the condenser coil, where the
 condensation step occurs."
```
————————————

Then, you need to describe condensation, expansion, and evaporation in much the same way as we dealt
with compression.

**5.** The final section of the process description briefly summarizes the process and provides a
  sense of finality to the document.

```
"The operation of an air conditioner involves four steps. First, the compressor pumps refrigerant
 under pressure into the condenser coil. Here it is liquefied, giving up heat that is removed by a
 fan circulating air over the condenser coil. The liquid refrigerant moves through a close loop,
 through an expansion valve, and into the lower-pressure evaporator coil. Here the refrigerant
 changes into a vapor, absorbing heat from air passing over the evaporator coil. This air then
 cools the controlled environment, While the refrigerant is drawn back into the compressor. At this
 point the cycle is complete and the process repeats."
```
