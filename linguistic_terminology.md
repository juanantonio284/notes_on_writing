## Head
<!-- page 109 -->

The head is the element in a phrase which is chiefly responsible for the nature of that phrase.
Every phrase in every language is built up from smaller units according to certain rather rigid
rules. The several different types of phrase are distinguished from one another to some extent by
differences in structure but mainly by the nature of the item (usually a word) around which it is
constructed; that item is the ***lexical head***, the ***headword***, or simply the ***head***, of
the phrase, and it usually provides the name for the kind of phrase built up around it.

For example:

* The **noun phrase** the `little girl in the blue dress` is built up around the noun `girl` as its
  head; the whole phrase denotes some kind of girl. 

* The **verb phrase** `sang quietly to herself` is built up around the verb `sang` as its head; the
  whole phrase denotes some specific kind of singing. 

* The **adjective phrase** `pretty as a picture` is headed by the adjective `pretty`.

* The **adverb phrase** `very slowly` is headed by the adverb `slowly`.

* The **prepositional phrase** `under the bed` is headed by the preposition `under`.

The concept of heads is an ancient one, but it largely disappeared from linguistics during the
earlier part of the twentieth century. Since the 1970s, however, heads have once again come to be
seen as grammatically central, and many contemporary theories of grammar assign them a very
prominent place; **one or two theories even take headedness to be the most important grammatical
notion of all**.

## Phrase

<!-- Page 218 -->

A phrase is a grammatical unit which is smaller than a clause. Every phrase is built up from
a *head*, an item (usually a single word) which itself determines what kind of phrase the whole
thing is. A one-word phrase consists of a head with no other material at all. 

The term *phrase* is an ancient one, and it has long been used to denote a grammatical unit which
typically consists of two or more words, but which does not contain all of the things found in a
clause. 

### Types of Phrases

* Noun phrase: `the little girl`
* Verb phrase: `was singing in the bath`
* Adjective phrase: `pretty as a picture`
* Prepositional phrase (a preposition with its object): `with her girlfriend`

Each of these types of phrase represents a single *phrasal category*, and a phrasal category is one
type of **syntactic category** – that is, it represents one of the basic building blocks used in
constructing sentences.

Observe that a phrase may consist of only a single word; for example, the sentence `Susie smiled`
consists of the noun phrase `Susie` and the verb phrase `smiled`. These units are phrases because
they occupy the positions of phrases and behave like phrases. (Strictly speaking, therefore, we
have here a verb phrase *smiled* which happens to consist only of the verb *smiled*.)

Occasionally, in modern linguistics, the term phrase is generalized to denote any syntactic unit in
a sentence (any *constituent*), of whatever size or nature. So, for example, in the sentence `Susie
discovered that she was pregnant`, the unit *she was pregnant* is a complete clause, and hence it
is not a phrase in the narrower sense of the term, but it is a phrase in this extended sense. 

## Noun Phrase

<!-- page 189 -->

A noun phrase is complete syntactic unit, a phrase, built around a noun which can act as a subject
or an object. Noun phrases are the only things that can act as subjects or objects in English
sentences.

Consider the sentence `A small party of Spanish adventurers managed to capture the Aztec capital.` A
traditional view of sentence structure holds that the subject and the direct object of the sentence
are the nouns *party* and *capital*, respectively. But this is not strictly correct. The true
subject and object are the noun phrases (NPs) `a small party of Spanish adventurers` and `the Aztec
capital`.

A noun phrase may be identified in two different ways:

1. It must occupy one of only a few possible slots in a sentence structure.

2. It must have one of only a few possible types of internal structure.

    * An English noun phrase is usually built up around a single noun, and that noun is the head of
      the noun phrase, the item which is chiefly responsible for the nature of the NP. (In my
      examples, *party* and *capital* are the heads of the two NPs. The first NP denotes a
      particular party, and the second a particular capital. The other words in the NP serve only
      to provide further identification.)

    * The most obvious exception is a noun phrase consisting of a pronoun. In the sentence `They
      managed to capture it`, the pronouns `they` and `it` make up complete NPs all by themselves,
      one serving as the subject, the other as the object. 
      
A noun phrase is one kind of syntactic category, there are also verb, adjective, adverb, and
prepositional phrases.

## Argument
<!-- page 23 -->

An argument is any one of the noun phrases required by a particular verb. Each verb requires some
number of noun phrases to accompany it in a sentence, if the result is to be grammatical; these NPs
are its arguments. (The number of NPs required by a verb is the ***valency*** of that verb.)

### Valency

The *simple intransitive* verbs 'smile' and 'arrive' are ***monovalent***, requiring only one
argument, the subject, as in Susie smiled. (Something like `*Susie smiled Natalie` is
ungrammatical; the asterisk marks this).  
The *simple transitive* verb like 'kiss' or 'slap' is ***divalent***, requiring a subject and one
object, as in `Susie kissed Natalie`. (Something like `*Susie kissed` is ungrammatical).  
A *ditransitive verb* like 'give' or 'show' is ***trivalent***, requiring a subject and two objects, 
as in `Susie gave Mike a present`.  
Note the *unusual case* of the verb *rain*, which neither requires nor permits any arguments at
all, except for the 'dummy' subject `it`, as in `It's raining`. This verb arguably has a valency of
zero. (A given English verb usually requires between one and three arguments.)

## Subject

<!-- page 282 -->

The subject is the primary argument of a sentence. Traditionally, the subject is the nominated actor
or 'doer' of the verb, though **many grammars distinguish the grammatical subject from the logical
or 'real' subject**: in `The baby was kissed by the politician`, the grammatical subject is
different from the logical subject.

A subject is prototypically a noun phrase, though it is possible for other parts of speech and
categories to act as subjects: verb phrases can be nominalized or rank-shifted to operate as
subjects—e.g. `Running up the hill is tiring`, `To finish this book is his main aim`.

Typical in English are existential statements (`There are ten boys here`), statements that introduce
modal forms (`It is true that there are no bananas`) or assertions about the weather (`It is
raining`).

## Clause

<!-- page 37 -->

A clause is the largest grammatical unit smaller than a sentence; it consists of a subject and a
predicate, and every sentence must consist of one or more clauses. 

A clause which is the highest-ranking, or only, clause in its sentence is a ***main clause***; a
clause which is subordinated to another is a ***subordinate clause***. Today we always regard a
subordinate clause as forming an integral part of the clause containing it
(its ***matrix clause***).

The clause is a traditional and fundamental unit of sentence structure, though the term is not used
by all grammarians in exactly the same way. Recently some grammarians have been extending the
term *clause* to every unit containing a verb, including many units traditionally regarded only as
phrases. Examples: `[Susie's heavy smoking] is affecting her health`; `Susie wants [to buy a new
car]`; `[Having finished her dinner]`, `Susie reached for her cigarettes`. This extended usage is
not standard, but it is now very widespread. 

### Examples 

* A simple sentence consists only of a single clause: [`Susie has bought a skirt`]. 

* A compound sentence consists of two or more clauses of equal rank, usually joined by a connecting
  word like *and*, *or*, or *but*: [`Susie wants children`], but [`her career won't allow them`]. 

* A complex sentence consists of two or more clauses where one out-ranks the others, which are
  subordinated to it: [`After she got her promotion`], [`Susie bought a new house`].

### Types of subordinate clause

<!-- examples below from Subordination section page 282 -->

* A ***complement clause*** is attached to a preceding word (usually a verb or a noun)
  and 'completes' the sense of that word:

    - `Janet suspects [that she is pregnant].`(a verb-complement clause)  
    - `Susie's announcement [that she was a lesbian] startled her parents.` (a noun-complement
      clause)  
    - `Susie is happy [that Natalie can move in with her].` (an adjective-complement clause)
    - `Susie has decided [that she will look for a new job].`  
    - `The rumour [that Susie is quitting] is not true.`


* A ***relative clause*** is attached to a preceding noun, which it modifies, and always contains a
  gap somewhere inside it: [the position of each gap is marked with the symbol *e* (for 'empty')]

    - `The job [that Susie wants *e*] involves a lot of travelling.`  
    - `The skirt [that Susie bought *e*] is too short.`
  
* An ***embedded question*** (or indirect question) is a question which is not being asked directly:

    - `I asked them [if they had seen Susie].`  
    - `Janet doesn't know [what she wants].`  
    - `Susie has not decided [what she is going to do].`

* An ***adverbial clause*** behaves like an adverb within its sentence and must be introduced by a
  suitable marker of subordination (such as *when*, *if*, *because*, *whenever*, etc.)
  
    - `[When Susie gets here], we'll have dinner.`
    - `[If you need any help], give me a ring.`
    - `Susie is upset [because she has quarrelled with Natalie].`
    - `Susie develops a rash [whenever she eats strawberries].`

## Sentence 

<!-- page 256 -->

The sentence is the largest linguistic unit which is held together by rigid grammatical rules.

(Of course, there are larger linguistic units than sentences: individual paragraphs (in writing),
individual turns (in conversation) and individual discourses. But these larger units are no more
than very weakly linked by purely grammatical means.)

We need to clarify this term a little, since it is frequently misunderstood:

**For most linguists**, in most circumstances, a sentence is an abstract linguistic object:
specifically, it is a linguistic object put together entirely in accordance with the rules for
constructing sentences in a language, rules which have to be identified (in a linguistic
description) by patient and painstaking investigation. 
  
More particularly, a sentence does not have to be something which somebody might reasonably say, and
not everything that we might reasonably say is a sentence.

* Consider this exchange. `Mike: Where's Susie? Alice: In the library.` Here Mike's utterance
  represents a sentence, but Alice's response does not: even though it is a perfectly normal and
  unremarkable thing to say, `*In the library` is not a sentence of English because it is not
  constructed according to the rules for making English sentences. Instead, it is only
  a ***fragment*** of a sentence: we do not always speak in complete sentences, and we very often
  use fragments like this one.

* Now consider Noam Chomsky's famous example sentence: `Colourless green ideas sleep furiously`.
  Chomsky's point is that, even though this thing makes no sense at all, it is constructed in
  accordance with all the rules for making sentences in English, and hence it is a grammatical
  (well-formed) sentence of English.

A further point is that a sentence is not just a string of words; rather, it is a string of words
with a grammatical (syntactic) structure assigned to it. Consequently, an ambiguous string of words
like `Visiting relatives can be a nuisance` or `I saw her duck` represents two (or more) quite
different sentences, each with its own structure. We often take advantage of this possibility of
assigning different structures to identical or similar strings of words for humorous effect, as in
the old gag `Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana` and in the punchline of a certain
cat-food commercial: `Cats like Felix like Felix`. (**Pragmatics** makes the useful distinction
between the abstract sentence and the actual spoken or written **utterance**.)
