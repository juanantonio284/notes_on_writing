## 2.1 Wayward Modifiers

> "In literature, the ambition of the novice is to acquire the literary language. The struggle of
   the adept is to get rid of it." — George Bernard Shaw

Modifiers are words and phrases that give more specific information about the words—in most cases
nouns and pronouns—after which they are used.

The guiding principle for the use of modifiers in English is that the writer should place them next
to the word or phrase that it modifies. Whenever a modifier is not placed where it belongs, the
reader immediately gets confused and frustrated by the meaning of the sentence.

### Three major types of modifier problems

**1. Squinting modifiers**

[Teacher did not explain clearly ...]

Squinting modifiers can be hard to define when you're looking over what you've written because,
being the writer of your paper, you know what you mean and you unconsciously assume that what you
have written is correct and anyone is supposed to understand what you have written. But this can be
wrong.

Compare the two sentences below:

* `At our first meeting we agreed to implement the new procedure.`

* `We agreed to implement the new procedure at our first meeting.`

The first one means that, at the first meeting an agreement was made to implement a procedure
(the main idea of the sentence is more related to what happened at a meeting). The second one means
that at some other point in time, an agreement was made to implement a procedure when the first
meeting happens (the main idea of the sentence is more related to the agreement, or to the
implementation, than it is to the meeting )

**2. Misplaced modifiers**

A misplaced modifier is a modifier in the wrong place. Theoretically, at least, the placement
of 'only' may affect writing but, practically, it doesn't matter much.

* `The committee only seemed interested in their proposal. X`

* `The committee seemed interested only in their proposal. ✓`

**3. Dangling Modifier**

A dangling modifier is hard nut to crack. A dangling modifier is a modifying phrase, often
introductory, with no known present for it to refer to in a sentence. Therefore, it dangles in a
sentence. In some cases it is called hanging modifier. It is called dangling or hanging because it
dangles in the sentence and the noun that it is supposed to modify is missing.

A dangling modifier is a phrase that modifies a noun that does not appear in the sentence. Dangling
modifiers, in most cases, are considered as grammatical errors.

*Example 1*

"`Turning to Table 4, quite a few differences are found`".

Here's the solution, a very quick fix. You should put the noun and pronoun immediately after the
scripted phrase. If you do not do this your reader would be confused and the sentence would sound
unnatural and obscure. Then the sentence would read: `turning to Table 4, we find several
differences`.

One common question among academic writers when they first encountered dangling pronouns, is how to
rewrite their sentence with both correct structure and good academic style. And, not surprisingly,
their concern arises from their fear of using 'I' and 'we', as they think that these pronouns will
diminish the quality of their scholarly writing. But as we already know from the previous lesson,
that `I` and `we` are a powerful tool to show that you take responsibility for your research.

*[Example 2][dangling_example]*

'Based on' is an extremely common dangling modifier problem. This phrase appears in almost every
 research paper, yet researchers use this phrase incorrectly. To use this phrase correctly, the
 writer should understand and visualize the concept of something *being based on* something.
 
`Based on the results, we concluded that the drugs are equally effective.`

(What is based on the results? Implied subject = conclusion; grammatical subject = we)

Correction 1: On the basis of the results, we concluded that the drugs are equally effective.

Correction 2: We concluded from the results that the drugs are equally effective.

Correction 3: Based on the results, our conclusion is that the drugs are equally effective.

## 2.2 Hidden Negation

There are many words with negative meaning, and some of them are not obviously negative.

Take the word 'debatable'. It seems to be a synonym to 'arguable', though the word 'debatable' has a
negative connotation which 'arguable' lacks. And when writer uses this word 'debatable', he or she
expresses his or her disagreement with a statement, and in the same way as the
word 'questionable'.

The words might have a hidden negative meaning: `excessive`, `overstated`, `extreme`, `speculative`,
`at first sight`, `feeble`, `limited`, `hard to accept`

They seem to be useful in two ways, so you may use these words in two ways: first, they're more
polite than negative words of a more obvious kind; and secondly, if you want to vary your writing,
especially if you're making too many negations. [What kind of advice is this?]

Avoid negative sentences as affirmative sentences are clearer, more condensed and precise. When
readers encounter negative phrases in writing, first they have to identify the important word and
negate this word. 

For example, instead of "he didn't pass the exam" you should write "he failed the exam".

Here are some common negatives and their affirmative equivalents:

```
Not able ⟶ unable
Not certain ⟶ uncertain
Not clearly ⟶ unclearly
Not many ⟶ few
Not the same as ⟶ different from
Did not ⟶ failed
(We did not achieve the expected results ⟶ We failed to achieve the expected results)
Does not have ⟶ lacks
```

**Example**

We change each of following sentences from a negative to a positive:

* The plan did not work
	- The plan failed.

* From a theoretical analysis, we can show that this assignment is not correct.
	- From a theoretical analysis, we can show that this assignment is incorrect.

* The solution does not have any modal transaction.
	- The solution lacks modal transaction.

* Do not forget to add a boiling stick, boiling stone, or a spin bar while heating.
	- Remember to add a boiling stick, boiling stone, or a spin bar while heating.

* Not many scientists know what valorisation is.
	- Few scientists know what valorisation is.

* Reducing inflation is not possible if the government is not able to reduce spending.
	- Reducing inflation is impossible if the government is unable to reduce spending.

## 2.3 Active vs Passive

> “People often use the passive voice because it's indirect, polite, unaggressive, and admirably
   suited to making thoughts seem as if nobody had personally thought them and deeds seem as if
   nobody had done them, so that nobody need take responsibility. Thus the passive voice is beloved
   of bureaucrats and timid academics.” — Ursula K. Le Guin

Of all the strategies for creating strong, readable, academic writing, every writer should place
pruning and using the active voice at the top.

Use a structure as such: subject, verb, object. This sentence is clear and direct, with its moving
across the page in the same direction as our eyes move while reading.

Converting the passive voice to the active voice calls for the writer to put the true subject first.
