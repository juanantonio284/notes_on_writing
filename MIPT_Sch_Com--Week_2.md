## 2.1 Wayward Modifiers

> "In literature, the ambition of the novice is to acquire the literary language. The struggle of
   the adept is to get rid of it." — George Bernard Shaw

Modifiers are words and phrases that give more specific information about the words after which they
are used.

The guiding principle for the use of modifiers in English is that the writer should place them next
to the word or phrase that it modifies. Whenever a modifier is not placed where it belongs, the
reader immediately gets confused and frustrated by the meaning of the sentence.

### Three major types of modifier problems

**1. Squinting modifiers**

Squinting modifiers can be hard to define when you're looking over what you've written because,
being the writer of your paper, you know what you mean and you unconsciously assume that what you
have written is correct and anyone is supposed to understand what you have written; but this can be
wrong.

Compare the two sentences below:

* `At our first meeting we agreed to implement the new procedure.`
* `We agreed to implement the new procedure at our first meeting.`

The first one means that, at the first meeting an agreement was made to implement a procedure
(the main idea of the sentence is more related to what happened at a meeting). The second one means
that at some other point in time, an agreement was made to implement a procedure when the first
meeting happens (the main idea of the sentence is more related to the agreement, or to the
implementation, than it is to the meeting).

**2. Misplaced modifiers**

A misplaced modifier is a modifier in the wrong place. Theoretically, at least, the placement
of 'only' may affect writing but, practically, it doesn't matter much.

* `The committee only seemed interested in their proposal. X`
* `The committee seemed interested only in their proposal. ✓`

**3. Dangling Modifier**

A dangling modifier is a modifying phrase, often introductory, with no known present for it to refer
to in a sentence. Therefore, it dangles in a sentence. In some cases it is called hanging modifier.
It is called dangling or hanging because it dangles in the sentence and the noun that it is
supposed to modify is missing.

A dangling modifier is a phrase that modifies a noun that does not appear in the sentence. Dangling
modifiers, in most cases, are considered as grammatical errors.

* *Example 1*: `Turning to Table 4, quite a few differences are found.`

    Here's the solution: put the noun and pronoun immediately after the scripted phrase. If you do
    not do this your reader would be confused and the sentence would sound unnatural and obscure.
    Then the sentence would read: `turning to Table 4, we find several differences`.

    One common question among academic writers when they first encountered dangling pronouns, is how
    to rewrite their sentence with both correct structure and good academic style. And, not
    surprisingly, their concern arises from their fear of using `I` and `we`, as they think that
    these pronouns will diminish the quality of their scholarly writing. But as we already know
    from the previous lesson, these pronouns are a powerful tool to show that you take
    responsibility for your research.

* *Example 2*: `Based on the results, we concluded that the drugs are equally effective.`

    [From http://www.biomedicaleditor.com/grammar-tip-dangling.html]

    'Based on' is an extremely common dangling modifier problem. This phrase appears in almost every
    research paper, yet researchers use this phrase incorrectly. To use this phrase correctly, the
    writer should understand and visualize the concept of something *being based on* something.
   
    (What is based on the results? Implied subject = conclusion; grammatical subject = we)

    - Correction 1: On the basis of the results, we concluded that the drugs are equally effective.
    - Correction 2: We concluded from the results that the drugs are equally effective.
    - Correction 3: Based on the results, our conclusion is that the drugs are equally effective.

## 2.2 Hidden Negation

There are many words with negative meaning, and some of them are not obviously negative.

Take the word 'debatable'. It seems to be a synonym to 'arguable', though the word 'debatable' has a
negative connotation which 'arguable' lacks. And when writer uses this word 'debatable', he or she
expresses his or her disagreement with a statement, and in the same way as the
word 'questionable'.

The words might have a hidden negative meaning: `excessive`, `overstated`, `extreme`, `speculative`,
`at first sight`, `feeble`, `limited`, `hard to accept`

Avoid negative sentences as affirmative sentences are clearer, more condensed and precise. When
readers encounter negative phrases in writing, first they have to identify the important word and
negate this word. 

For example, instead of "he didn't pass the exam" you should write "he failed the exam".

### Common negatives and their affirmative equivalents

* `Not able ⟶ unable`
* `Not certain ⟶ uncertain`
* `Not clearly ⟶ unclearly`
* `Not many ⟶ few`
* `Not the same as ⟶ different from`
* `Did not ⟶ failed`
* `(We did not achieve the expected results ⟶ We failed to achieve the expected results)`
* `Does not have ⟶ lacks`

**Example**: We change each of following sentences from a negative to a positive

* `The plan did not work  ⟶   The plan failed`
* `This conclusion is not correct  ⟶   This conclusion is not correct`
* `Do not forget to ...   ⟶   Remember to add ...`
* `The solution does not have any modal transaction  ⟶   The solution lacks modal transaction`
* `Not many scientists know what valorisation is   ⟶   Few scientists know what valorisation is`
* `Reducing inflation is not possible if ...  ⟶   Reducing inflation is impossible`

## 2.3 Active vs Passive

> “People often use the passive voice because it's indirect, polite, unaggressive, and admirably
   suited to making thoughts seem as if nobody had personally thought them and deeds seem as if
   nobody had done them, so that nobody need take responsibility. Thus the passive voice is beloved
   of bureaucrats and timid academics.” — Ursula K. Le Guin

Of all the strategies for creating strong, readable, academic writing, every writer should place
pruning and using the active voice at the top.

Use a structure as such: subject, verb, object. This sentence is clear and direct, with its moving
across the page in the same direction as our eyes move while reading.

Converting the passive voice to the active voice calls for the writer to put the true subject first.

* `the experimental data are presented in table 1 X`
* `table 1 presents the experimental data ✓`

# Week 2, Part 2: Sentence Structure

## 2.4 - Tenses in Scientific Writing

[Note: I object to the idea of memorizing when a tense should be used. It's something to keep in
mind, and one should look at well-written research papers and try to find commonalities, but I
don't like this lesson. The bullet points are an improvement over the way the material was
presented originally; but still much could be mistranscribed (really the lesson and the way the
teacher spoke was unclear). The bullet points below certainly shouldn't be used to memorize
something like "the past simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a well
known scientist" ... In fact, I would skip this section altogether and find a better, primary
source. I only leave it here as a quick read and something to keep in mind.]

Choosing a tense is not a trivial thing, it is really crucial for an effective scientific writing.

In science writing, there are three basic tenses that are most often used:

* the present simple tense forms 70\% of all the tense forms
* the past simple tense 23\% of all the tense forms
* the present perfect tense about 5\%

The remaining tenses are rarely used in science writing.

Tenses manage time in the research paper. By using a particular tense, you show your reader your
attitude towards your research. Your attitude towards other scientists' research. It demonstrates
whether you regard particular findings as relevant or irrelevant, or whether you just state a past
fact, whether you tell that either what somebody did in the past is the foundation for your
research, but it is not for relevant for the current moment.

*Example*: `"The work demonstrated the use of XPS to characterize the chemistry of materials".`

In this case the past simple tense is used and it demonstrates that the research has been completed
and you are just stating what happened. If you write the same sentence using the present perfect
tense ("`the work *has* demonstrated a new use of XPS to characterize the chemistry of materials`")
you show that the research is still in progress. Or, if it is not in progress, the result of this
research is really relevant for this current moment.

Let's speak about these three tenses in more detail:

The **present simple tense** is used: 

* in the introduction to report what we already know, and to report the topic of the research.
  When you use the present simple tense in the conclusion, then you use it to transmit information
  that has become known
* in the conclusion to say that, now that you know that a fact is relevant, this information is
  crucial
* to make a general statement, conclusion, or interpretation of previous studies or data
  refocusing on what is now known
* to express consent with other authors; we show our agreement with the previous studies.

The **past simple tense** uses verbs in the passive voice, and is used:
* to write about a special study implemented by a well known scientist
* to describe methods and data of the completed study
* in the description of methods and processes
* to demonstrate the details of our experiment, to show that we did something while carrying out the
  experiment

The **present perfect tense** is used:

* to show to your reader that the results of the previous studies to date are relevant
* to summarize the results of studies carried out previously ("`researchers have found`", 
"`studies have suggested`")
* to indicate the connection of the previous studies to those that are currently underway
