## 2.1 - What's In A Name?

Technical writers write technical and software manuals, handbooks, technical guides, and provide
online help. Anyone who writes about technology for other people is typically referred to as a
technical writer.

The United States Department of Labor, recognizes technical writer as a distinct job category,
stating that technical writers produce instruction manuals and other supporting documents to
communicate complex and technical information more easily. They also develop, gather, and
disseminate technical information among customers, designers and manufacturers.

[The Society for Technical Communication][], the largest professional organization dedicated to
advance in the arts and sciences of technical communication, would call a technical writer a
technical communicator. Besides, a technical writer can be called as a documentation specialist,
information developer, to name just a few.

### Skills

Like any profession, becoming a technical writer requires a mastery of a certain set of skills:

1. Clear writing

    The technical writer needs to **write in a clear and concise manner and to be able to convey
    information appropriately for a variety of audiences**.

    Technical skills of a technical writer, depend greatly on the subject matter, product or service
    that require documentation. Hardware and software documentation differ in the skills that the
    technical writer needs. Additionally, pharmaceuticals and other manufacturing industries have
    specific requirements that translate into knowledge the technical writer must have. A technical
    writer who has been asked to document a developer's guide might need to have a pretty good
    handle on specific programming languages. While a technical writer who has been tasked into
    documenting a weapons defense systems might need a high degree of engineering comprehension. As
    well as a solid knowledge of document, or government documentation standards.

2. Use of technology

    Needless to say, a technical writer needs to **know his or her way around computer systems,
    since they're used to produce documentation in a variety of formats**. Specific tool knowledge
    such as Adobe FrameMaker, MS Word, MadCap Flare, RoboHelp, and even PageMaker and Quark.

3. A desire to learn, ask questions, and listen

    Technical writers are accustomed to learning; it's really what they do, and most are capable of
    learning a new tool quickly and efficiently. Technical writers need to know how to ask
    questions. They also need to know who is the best person to approach to and they need to have a
    feel for the right personalities and preferences of the people, the Subject Matter Experts
    (SMEs) in order to know how best to approach them. Strong listening skills will very quietly
    capture the information necessary and will serve to know which follow-up questions need to be
    asked. 

4. Appreciation for design

    An appreciation of the visual can also be an important part of a skill set of a technical
    writer: even the easiest technical documents do not consist of just written word. To a growing
    extent, the technical writer needs an appreciation for graphics and formatting as well
    illustration skills. Depending on the needs of the organization, these skills may only need to
    be rudimentary or they may need to be very advanced.

5. Be aware of usability, help with testing

    A technical writer may also get asked to take an active role in usability and testing. Even if
    not asked to take a role technical writer knows that validation of the documentation is
    important. The confirmation that the product works the way it is documented to work. In some
    organizations, the technical writer is an important part of the user experience team. 
    

Broadly stated a good technical writer creates or gathers technical information and then organizes
it and present it in such a way that it is understandable and useful to the defined audience. In
other words technical writers produce documentation. (Documentation refers to any content, written,
illustrated or both, supporting the use, operation, maintenance, or design of a product or service.
It can be in the form of a printable or a webpage, help in software or on a mobile device, a video,
blog, wiki, or more, but it's all still documentation.)

Technical writers work in a wide range of industries. Among them software, Internet, e-commerce,
networking, telecommunications, bioengineering, semiconductor, aerospace, hard science, medicine,
automobile, government, heavy equipment, the armed forces, and manufacturing. Also the subject
matter is different. Processes and methods for producing documentation are often the same across
widely different fields.

## 2.2 Characteristics of Technical Writing

Technical writing is targeted to readers who are looking for information on a particular topic.

The goal in targeting this group is to make sure that the information provided is clear, concise,
and easy for everyone to understand.

While there are different types of writing that are informative, technical writing is the type that
most clearly focuses on presenting information in a specific way so that people can use the
information for a variety of different purposes.

### Characteristics of Technical Reports

* are designed for quick and easy communication of information
* are designed for selective reading
* use different sections with numbered headings and subheadings
* use figures and diagrams to convey data

**Consider**:

* how well it is adapted to a specific audience
* how clear and readable it is
* how it flows
* how it is organized
* how much detail it provides

### The Writer's Job

The writer's must define

* the report topic: decide the subject you are going to write on; narrow it as much as possible

* the report audience: define a specific person, or group of people you are targeting. Be clear on
  what they know or don't know in relation to the topic, what experience, background they have in
  relation to the topic, and why they want, or might need this information.

* the report purpose: define what the report will accomplish. What needs of the audience it is going
  to fulfill. **What are the circumstances that bring about the need for this information?**

* the report type: decide on the type of report (technical background report, feasibility report,
  instructions, etc.)

### Attributes That All Documentation Should Have

No matter what user you are writing for there are certain attributes that all documentation should
have before it can be considered good (in roughly this order of importance).

Good technical documentation must be:

* correct
* complete
* usable
* clear
* consistent

Other important characteristics of documentation:

* design and layout
* positive out-of-the-box experience
* context-sensitivity
* searchability

### Six major characteristics of a technical document

1. Addresses particular readers
2. Helps readers solve problems
3. Reflects the organization's goals and culture
4. Is produced collaboratively
5. Uses design to increase readability
6. Consists of words or images or both

**1. Addresses particular readers**  
    Knowing who the readers are, what they understand about the subject, how well they speak
    English, and how they will use the document will help you decide what type of document to
    write, how to structure it, how much detail to introduce; and what sentence style and
    vocabulary to use.

**2. Helps readers solve problems**

**3. Reflects the organization's goals and culture**  
    For example, many organizations encourage their employees to blog about their areas of expertise
    to create a positive image of the organization.

**4. Is produced collaboratively**  
    No one person has all the information, skills, or time to create a large document. You will work
    with subject matter experts, the various technical professionals, to create a better document
    than you have been working alone. You will routinely post questions to networks of friends and
    associates both inside and outside the organization to get answers to technical questions.

**5. Uses design to increase readability**  
    Technical communicators use design features such as typography, spacing and color to make a
    document attractive so that it creates a positive impression, helps readers navigate the
    document to understand it.

**6. Consists of words or images or both**  
    Images, both static and moving can make a document more interesting and appealing to readers.
    Images can help the writer communicate and reinforce difficult concepts, communicate
    instructions and descriptions of objects and processes, and communicate large amounts of
    quantifiable data. They are also useful to communicate with nonnative speakers.

## 2.3 Measures of Excellence in Technical Documents

### Eight characteristics distinguish excellent technical documents

1. Honesty
2. Clarity
3. Accuracy
4. Comprehensiveness
5. Accessibility
6. Conciseness
7. Professional Appearance
8. Correctness

**1. Honesty**  
    The most important measure of excellence in a technical document is honesty. You need to tell
    the truth and not mislead the reader not only because it is the right thing to do but also
    because readers can get hurt if you're dishonest. (Finally, if you're dishonest, you and your
    organization will face serious legal charges. If a court finds that your document's failure to
    provide honest and appropriate information caused a substantial injury or loss, the
    organization might have to pay millions of dollars.)

**2. Clarity**  
    Your goal is to create a document that conveys a single meaning that readers can understand
    easily. An unclear technical document can be dangerous. A callously drafted building code, for
    example, could tempt constructors to use inferior materials and techniques. (In addition, an
    unclear technical document is expensive. Handling a telephone call to customer support center
    cost $5 to $10 for a simple question. But about $20 to $45 for a more complicated problem and
    about a third of the cost are even a more expensive kind. Clear technical communication in the
    product's documentation can greatly reduce these problems.)

**3. Accuracy**  
    A slight inaccuracy can confuse and annoy readers. A major inaccuracy can be dangerous and
    expensive. In some sense, accuracy is a question of ethics: technical documents must be as
    objective and unbiased as you can make them; if readers suspect that you are slanting
    information by overstating or omitting facts, they will doubt the validity of the entire
    document. 

**4. Comprehensiveness**  

A good technical document provides readers with a complete self-contained discussion that enables
them to use the information safely, efficiently, and effectively. Thus, a good technical document:

* provides the information readers need
* describes the background so that readers unfamiliar with the subject can understand it
* contains sufficient detail so that readers can follow the discussion and carry out any required
  tasks
* refers to supporting materials clearly or includes them as attachments

**5. Accessibility**  
    Most technical documents are made up of small, independent sections. Because few people will
    read a document from the beginning to the end, your job is to make its various parts
    accessible: readers should not be forced to flip through the pages, or click links
    unnecessarily to find the appropriate section. 

**6. Conciseness**  
    A document must be concise enough to be useful to a busy reader. You can shorten most writing by
    10 to 20 per cent simply by eliminating unnecessary phrases, choosing shorter words and using
    economical grammatical forms. Your job is to figure out how to convey a lot of information
    economically. 

**7. Professional Appearance**  
    You start to communicate before anyone reads the first word of the document. If the document
    looks neat and professional, readers will form a positive impression of the document, and of
    you. Your document should adhere to the format standards of your organization or your
    professional field and it should be well designed. For example, a letter should follow one of
    the traditional letter formats and have generous margins. 

**8. Correctness**  
    A correct document is one that adheres to the conventions of grammar, punctuation, spelling,
    mechanics, and language use. Sometimes, incorrect writing can confuse readers, or even make
    your writing inaccurate. The most typical problem, however, is that incorrect writing makes you
    look unprofessional. If your writing is full of errors, readers will wonder if you were also
    careless in gathering, analyzing and presenting the technical information. If readers doubt
    your professionalism, they will be less likely to accept your conclusions or follow your
    accommodations.

# Week 2, Lesson 2: The Deliverables

## 2.4 The Content Approach (documentation deliverable)

There is no recipe to tell you exactly what specific documentation a deliverable should be made up
of. But it's a good idea to start out by defining a few types of documentation deliverables and
built around them. You can make your life easier by making decisions about what type of information
go into what document.

Then, avoid copying information from one document into another. Tempting as it may be, to assist
your user by including key information in every place, in every section, where you think it can be
helpful, it can cause problems with maintenance and consistency. It's a sure thing that you'll
update information in one place, but not another. It is embarrassing when you discover that one of
your documents contains outdated information while it's correct in another.

No matter what your final output, this is a good time to start thinking about the fact that you will
probably plan to use a great deal of your content in multiple output forms.

* Single-sourcing refers to the development of content with the intent of producing all of the parts
  of the document in multiple formats, instead of copying content into different files and formats,
  and maintaining it in more than one place. 
  
    - The content exists in one place only. Typically, this means that you have many files stored in
      one location, and you use all of them in each individual deliverable. 
      
    - Single-sourcing can be as simple as creating a single file of content that you'll then
      generate for print PDF or HTML. Or it can involve the creation of many small modular topics
      and conditional content files that a tag mix and match to build different types of output. In
      all cases, changes are made only to one file, the source file. For example, the help and user
      guide for an application are likely to share most of the content. In fact, if you are
      creating a user guide, online help, a data sheet, and help for a mobile device for the same
      product, they are very likely to share some content.

* Content reuse refers to the management of content by breaking it into small enough components or
  topics so that each topic can be used in the appropriate place.

* Topic-oriented writing is writing that is intended for use. Each topic is a unit of information
  that stands out and can be mixed and matched with other units. If you're accustomed to writing in
  a linear narrative style, topic oriented writing may require some effort to learn.

### Decisions to make about how you present the documentation content

These decisions depend on:

* What users need to know
* How users will use the documentation
* How much time you have to work on the project
* How many different deliverables are produced from the same content

In addition to those decisions, you need to decide whether your documentation is **task-based**
or **reference-based**. Choosing one of these forms depends not only on what the user needs, but
also on how much time you have to work on the project, and how much content we use is involved?

#### Task Based Approach

Task-based documentation is about what the user does (with instructions on how to operate the
product to accomplish the task the user performs). This could involve moving back and forth between
different screens, different manuals, and perhaps, combining a number of shorter processes to
accomplish the goal.

As you develop task-based documentation:

* Clearly define the starting and the stopping points for each task

    - What is the first step the user does to start the procedure? What is the final step that
      indicates success?

* Use a consistent format (a set of numbered steps are typical) to present each task, the
  description of the task, the purpose of the task, and a lead-in heading

As you write these tasks, you may realize that the software and hardware has functionality and
features that you never mentioned at all. Many products have a lot more features than are commonly
used. Think of how many things your phone and camera can do that you have never even tried
yourself. Some products have legacy functionality that isn't used in any workflow. Those little
used functions can be saved for a reference manual, or a more detailed version of the user guide.
You will have to document them somewhere because customers of older versions, who use those
functions will want to know where they are in this version.

#### Reference Based Approach

In the reference-based approach, the focus is on what the product does; what the product looks like;
what each menu, item, and button does; what information goes into a text field. Then it's up to the
users to decide how to put all these components together to accomplish their goals; and, because of
that, it's not always the right way to provide user information.

But reference-based documentation has its place. There are many types of documentation in which this
is the only way to build (e.g. glossaries, descriptive documentation of all types, and release
notes). It also takes less time to develop than *task-based documentation*, because there is less
thinking and planning. When you're short on time, and you have the budget to produce only a single
piece of documentation for your product, you may choose to provide reference-based user
documentation.

You can plan to go back later and expand it to a task-based approach. To create reference-based user
documentation, go through the application's or device's user interface, and describe each single
component accurately and consistently.

### Scenario-based information

This is information that is designed and written to support user's progress through scenarios to
achieve goals. When you write scenario-based information instead of thinking of a scenario as one
topic that you write, you think of a scenario as the basis for everything you write.

You identify the key goals for users of the product and for each goal, and then you create a
scenario (or path) or how users will accomplish the goal. 

Know the goals of your users, and follow the path through the products yourself. The path might
involve several large, medium or small tasks, and you need to learn how to do all of them. By
following the path yourself, you can ensure that the embedded assistance is clear and supports the
goal. And you can learn and document the necessary steps to get users from the beginning of the
scenario to the end.

## 2.5 Acquiring The Three Types of Knowledge

There are three types of knowledge every technical writer needs to acquire to succeed:

1. Product knowledge
2. Technical knowledge
3. User knowledge

**1. Product knowledge**  
Understanding the product you are talking about: hat might include information about its
application, function, features, use and support requirements.

**2. Technical knowledge**  
Having logical understanding of how systems and processes work and interact with each other. Instead
of depending on subject matter experts for everything, you can become the subject matter expert
yourself.

There are many reasons why it's a good idea for a technical writer to gain extensive product and
technical knowledge:

* You will gain respect of the developers and be able to talk to them with some intelligence

* You will be able to determine whether information you receive or read is correct

* You will be able to write much faster than you would if you know nothing

* You would have confidence that your documentation is accurate even when it has not been
  sufficiently reviewed by subject matter experts

**3. User knowledge**  
When you become well versed in the user aspects of the product about which you are writing, you will
find it much easier to write. You should strive to get knowledge of each of the following:

- A product management understanding of how the product behaves, looks, meets the necessary
  requirements, and serves the needs of the customers
- A quality assurance understanding when it comes to being at were if something does not work as
  expected
- A user experience understanding of who the product is or how easy the product is to use
- An engineering understanding of the technology behind the product
- A business development specialist understanding of how important this product is to the business
  plans of your company

### Product Knowledge

Why is product knowledge among the three most essential types of knowledge? 

Since you are writing about the product, you have to know a lot about this product. But the
interesting part about getting product knowledge is that technical writers often are not real users
of the product they document. To do this, you need to learn a wide body of research skills; for
example, do a good interview, or set up a small focus group, or send out a very direct survey. 

Each time you have to step back and go to the user's questions: what will users be using it for?
What are their primary needs? What obstacles might get in their way? How they are going to use it?
And who's going to use it? 

These three types of knowledge often overlap. You need to learn a lot of things about the product
and byproduct. I would include the whole domain where the product's contexts is it's sort of
industry or market awareness. But all you need to really focus on what the user wants to know about
that product. 

There's one more aspect I want to touch upon in terms of gaining product knowledge by being the
user. And this is probably the most important thing about any job, regardless of your like or
dislike of the product:

**You have to test out all of the instructions.**

It sounds somewhat trivial, but the more technical the position you have, the more difficult it
becomes. In whatever programming language or technical domain you're approaching, there are endless
amounts of things you could learn. This is why you have to filter down to the product. What part of
this technical domain is relevant based on the product? What helps you filter down the whole
immensity of technical information you could possibly have to in more manageable subset.

### Technical Knowledge

Gaining the technical knowledge is one of the most challenging aspects of developing the product
documentation. You need to teach yourself. And that's the key to a technical communicator. You have
to be always eager to learn something you and not be afraid of it. By large, you need to learn how
to learn and you have to be open to that. The other thing you have to do is learn how to ask really
good questions. Asking good questions is hard especially when it comes to technical staff. If you
can match asking a good question with using your basic understanding, you get to the deeper
knowledge of the subject and that's a life long learning.

### User Knowledge

As for the user knowledge, you have to look at analytics on various webpages, user forums. Where you
can get information about potential uses, concerns and interests. Fashion and demographics
research, annual engineering surveys. You should know what your audience wants.

# Week 2, Lesson 3: Let The Writing Begin

## 2.6 Understanding Audience and Purpose

The writing process consists of five steps:

1. Planning
2. Drafting
3. Revising
4. Editing
5. Proofreading

For each of your most important readers try to answer the following three questions:

1. Who is the reader? Consider such factors:  

	* education
	* job experience
	* their responsibilities
	* skills in reading English
	* cultural characteristics
	* personal preferences

2. What are your readers attitudes and expectations? Consider the reader's attitudes toward the
topic in your message, as well as the reader's expectations about the kind of documents you will be
presenting.

3. Why and how would reader use your document?. Think about what readers will do with the document.
List some quotes in their physical environment in which they will use it. The techniques they will
use it in reading it, and the tasks they will carry out after they finish reading it.

You cannot start to write until you state the purpose or purposes of the document. Ask yourself
these two questions:

* After my readers have read the document, what do I want them to know or do?

* What beliefs or attitudes do I want them to hold?

A statement of purpose might be as simple as this: "the purpose of this report is to recommend
whether the company should adopt a health-promotion program".

————————————
<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈ 12 character line (EM Rule —) ≈≈≈≈ -->

For technical documents, it's best to turn to two kinds of people for help, subject-matter experts
and actual or potential users. Subject-matter experts can help you determine whether your facts or
explanations are accurate and appropriate. Actual users of your existing document (and potential
users of the next version of the document can help you see problems you other knowledgable readers
do not notice).

How do you learn from these individuals? Here are a few techniques:

* Surveying, interviewing or observing readers as they use the existing document
* Interviewing subject matter experts about the draft of the document
* Conducting focus groups to learn users or prosperous users opinions about an existing or proposed
  document

**Revisions**

It's specially important to revise draft documents that will be read and used by people of other
cultures. If your readers came from another culture try to have your draft reviewed by someone from
their culture. That reviewer can help you see whether you have made correct assumptions about how
readers will react to your ideas and whether you have chosen appropriate kinds of evidence and
design elements.

Having revised and made changes to content and organization, it's time for you to edit.

Editing is the process of checking the draft to improve its grammar, punctuation, style, usage, word
choice, and mechanics, such as use of numbers and abbreviations.

After editing, you should proofread your document to make sure you typed what you meant to type.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ --> 
## 2.7 Collaborative Writing

As a professional, you will have to work collaboratively on many projects. The best way to start
thinking about collaboration, is to understand its main advantages and disadvantages.

According to a survey conducted by Cisco Systems in 2010, more than 75% of those surveyed, said that
collaboration is critical to their success on the job. Some 90% said that collaboration makes them
more productive.

In this video lecture, I will tell you about wikis and shared document Workspaces. 

A wiki is a web based document that authorized users can write and edit. The best known wiki is
Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that contains some 4 million articles written by people around
the world. 

Many enterprise wikis such as Confluence, bundle rich text editors that remove the need for you to
wrestle or with complex markup. It's a relief to be able to get on with writing rather than hunting
down the one missing tag that's breaking your document.

Wiki is good for technical writers. It's not just the writing and publishing processes that are made
easier with wikis, gathering the information to write a technical document is often a collaborative
effort between the project managers, developers, and technical writers. Simply putting up an easy
draft for review often results in a wealth of useful feedback. As other people drop comments on the
page, or update the draft themselves. 

Wiki is good for customers, most wiki's have the traditional documentation tools that help time-poor
customers find the information they need. For example powerful search engines, tags, labels, bread
crumbs, navigation trees, and many others. Wikis can extend beyond those functions to provide
customers with richer content. It is easier to demonstrate a concept then explain it. Try adding a
video to your document. Need to describe a complicated procedure? Just embed the process diagram
into your wiki page. Add ons and plugins can be used to add innovative features like this, and more
to many basic wikis. 

Wiki is good for companies. A well maintained documentation wiki can help foster a customer
community. Good enterprise wiki's will provide you with tools like granular permissions, capture
and spam filters and let your community get involved safely with your documentation. Granular
permissions are usually a necessity when maintaining enterprise documentation on a wiki. This is a
feature that you probably won't find on open source wiki's, however you'd be surprise at how
competitively priced wiki solutions are.

A shared document workplace makes it convenient for a document of users to edit a file, such as a
Prezi or a PowerPoint slide set or a Word document. A shared document workplace, such as Microsoft
SharePoint,or Google Drive, are the archives. All the revisions made by each of the team members,
so that the team can create a single document that incorporates selected revisions. Some shared
document workplaces enable a user to download document, revise it on his or her computer and then
upload it again. This feature is extremely convenient because the user does not need to be
connected to the Internet to work on the document.

## 2.8 Writing For Multiple Audiences

Communicating effectively with people from another culture requires understanding a number of
cultural issues that lie on the surface.

A brief example. An American manufacturer of deodorant launched an advertising campaign in Japan in
which a cute octopus applied the firm's product under each of its eight arms. But the campaign
failed, because in Japan, an octopus is viewed as having eight legs, not eight arms.

Nancy Hoft in her book *International Technical Communication: How to Export Information about High
Technology* describes the following major issues:

* **Political** – this relates to legal issues. For example, some countries forbid imports of
    certain chemicals and laws about intercultural property, product safety, and liability.

* **Economic** – a country's level of economic development is a crucial factor. In many developing
    countries, most people cannot afford devices for accessing the Internet.

* **Social** – this covers many issues including gender and business custom. In most Western
    cultures, women play a much greater role in the workplace than they do in many Middle Eastern
    or Asian cultures.

* **Religious** – religious differences can affect diet or attributes towards, for example,
    individual colors.

* **Educational issues**

* **Technological issues** – you should know whether your readers have the hardware, the software,
    and technological infrastructure to use certain tools

* **Linguistic** – in many cultures, the orientation of text on a page and in a book is not from
    left to right.

### Eight suggestions for communicating more effectively with multicultural readers

1. Limit your vocabulary: every word should have only one meaning. It's called for simplified
English and in other basic English languages.

2. Keep the sentences short: there is no magic number, but try for an average sentence length of no
more than twenty words.

3. Define abbreviations and acronyms in a glossary: don't assume that your readers know that a "GFI"
is a ground fault interrupter because the abbreviation is derived from English vocabulary and word
order.

4. Avoid jargon unless you know your readers are familiar with this jargon: For instance, your
readers might not know what a "graphical user interface" is.

5. Avoid idioms and slang

6. Use the active voice whenever possible: the active voice is easier for nonnative speakers of
English to understand than the passive voice.

7. Be careful with graphics: the garbage can icon on the Macintosh computers does not translate well
because garbage cans might have different shapes and be made of different materials in other
countries.

8. Be sure someone from the target culture reviews document: even if you have had help in planning
the document, have it reviewed before you publish it and distribute it. One of the challenges of
writing to people from other cultures is that they are likely to be nonnative speakers of English.
One way to overcome the language barrier is to use effective graphics and the appropriate document
design. However, the most appropriate graphics and design can differ from culture to culture.
Business leaders in Australia use a different size paper and a different format than those in the
United States. An icon for a file folder in a software program created in the United States could
confuse European readers who use file folders of a different size and shape. A series of graphics
arranged left to right could confuse readers from Middle East who read from right to left. For this
reason, you should study samples of documents written by people from the cultures you're addressing
to learn the important differences.
