# A Big Summary of *The Penguin Guide to Punctuation*

## Introduction to this summary

* The asterisk `*` is used to mark a badly punctuated sentence

* [Note: Trask does not use the Oxford Comma, it has been added throughout this summary.
  (Other changes matching Oxford style have been made throughout.)]

* The punctuation described here is the style which is currently the norm in Britain and the
  Commonwealth. Standard American usage differs in a few respects ...

## Chapter 2: The Full Stop, the Question Mark and the Exclamation Mark

### 2.1 The Full Stop (`.`)

**Summary**

* Put a full stop at the end of a complete statement
* Do not connect two statements with a comma

<!-- 12 character line (EM Rule —) -->  
————————————

The full stop (`.`), also called the period, is chiefly used to mark the end of a sentence
expressing a statement:  
`I asked her whether she could tell me the way to Brighton.`

Two statements connected with a comma is one common error you must watch out for:  
`*Norway has applied for EC membership, Sweden is expected to do the same.`

The simplest way of fixing the example is to change the comma to a full stop:  
`Norway has applied for EC membership. Sweden is expected to do the same.`

You might consider it clumsy to use two short sentences in a row. If so, you can change the bad
example in a different way:   
`Norway has applied for EC membership, and Sweden is expected to do the same`.

#### Error: two statements linked with a comma

All of these examples suffer from the same problem: a comma has been used to join two complete
sentences. In each case, either the comma should be replaced by a full stop, or a suitable
connecting word should be added, such as *and* or *while*. (A semicolon could also be used—see
chapter 4.)

```

*Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries, its annual income is only $80 per person.

*The British are notoriously bad at learning foreign languages, the Dutch are famously good at it.

*The proposal to introduce rock music to Radio 3 has caused an outcry, angry letters have been
 pouring into the BBC.

*Borg won his fifth straight Wimbledon title in 1980, the following year he lost in the final to
 McEnroe.

```

<!-- 9.11 Priority Among Punctuation Marks -->
<!-- page 70 -->
* We never write two full stops at the end of a sentence.

Observe the following examples:

Officially, the clocks will go back at 2.00 a.m.

Leo Durocher never in fact made that famous remark "Nice guys finish last."

The abbreviation and the direct quotation already end in full stops, so no second full stop is
written.


### 2.2 The question mark (`?`)

**Summary**

* Use a question mark at the end of a direct question
* Do not use a question mark at the end of an indirect question
* Use an internal question mark to show that something is uncertain

<!-- 12 character line (EM Rule —) -->  
————————————

1. A question mark (`?`) is placed at the end of a sentence which is a direct question:  
`Does anyone have a pen I can borrow?`

2. A question mark is **not** used in an indirect question in which the speaker's exact words are
not repeated:  
`She asked if I had a pen she could borrow.`

3. **If** the question is a direct quotation, repeating the speaker's exact words, a question mark
is still used:  
`'Have you a pen I can borrow?' she asked.`

4. The question mark also has one minor use: it may be inserted into the middle of something, inside
parentheses, to show that something is uncertain:  
`The famous allegorical poem Piers Plowman is attributed to William Langland (?1332-?1400).`

<!-- 9.11 Priority Among Punctuation Marks -->
<!-- page 70 -->

* If a sentence would logically end in two question marks, only the first is written:  
  `Who wrote the sonnet that begins "How do I love thee?"`

* If a sentence-final quotation ends in a question mark or an exclamation mark, no full stop
  follows:  
  `Pontius Pilate famously asked, "What is truth?"`

* A question mark is written after a full stop if this is logically required:  
  `Does the flight arrive at 7.00 a.m. or 7.00 p.m.?`


### 2.3 The exclamation mark (`!`)

**Summary**

* Don't use an exclamation mark unless it's absolutely necessary
* Use an exclamation mark after an exclamation, especially after one beginning with *what* or *how*
* You should generally avoid using exclamation marks in your formal writing
* Don't use an exclamation mark unless you're certain it's necessary — and never use two or
  three of them in a row
  
<!-- 12 character line (EM Rule —) -->  
————————————

The exclamation mark (`!`) is used at the end of a sentence or a short phrase which expresses very
strong feeling:  
`What a lovely view you have here!`

Exclamation marks are quite normal in those kinds of writing that try to represent ordinary speech —
for example, in novels. But exclamation marks are usually out of place in formal writing. Using
them frequently will give your work a breathless, almost childish, quality.

An exclamation mark is also usual after an exclamation beginning with what or how:

* `What fools people can be!`
* `How well Marshall bowled yesterday!`

Note that such sentences are exclamations, and not statements. Compare them with statements:

* `People can be such fools.`
* `Marshall bowled very well yesterday.`

You can also use an exclamation mark to show that a statement is very surprising:  
`After months of careful work, the scientists finally opened the tomb. It was empty!`

### 2.4 A Final Point

Note that a full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark is never preceded by a white space.
Things like the following are wrong: `*How well has Darwin's theory stood up ?` **A sentence-final
punctuation mark is always written next to the last word of the sentence**.

### 2.5 Fragments

A fragment is a word or a phrase which stands by itself but which does not make up a complete
sentence. Fragments are very common in ordinary speech, in advertisements and even in newspapers.
They may be used very sparingly in formal writing; when used, they should be followed by a full
stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark, as appropriate: 

```

Will the Star Wars project ever be resumed? Probably not. 
We need to encourage investment in manufacturing. But how? 
Can England beat Australia? Absolutely! 

```

The judicious use of fragments can add vividness to your writing, and they are quite acceptable in
writing which is somewhat informal. But don't overdo them: if you use too many fragments, your work
will become breathless and disjointed.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## Chapter 3: The Comma (`,`)

[Note: Trask does not use the Oxford Comma, it has been added here]

**Forget anything you've ever been told about using a comma 'wherever you would pause'**, or
anything of the sort; this well-meaning advice is hopelessly misleading.

The comma has four distinct uses: listing, joining, gapping, bracketing.


### 3.1 The Listing Comma

**Summary**

* Use a listing comma in a list wherever you could conceivably use the word '`and`'
  (or '`or`') instead. Do not use a listing comma anywhere else

* Two options: 

    - Use a comma before '`and`' in a list (Oxford Comma):  
      `My favourite opera composers are Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, and Gilbert and Sullivan.`
      
    - Put a listing comma before '`and`' or '`or`' only if this is necessary to make your meaning
      clear
   
<!-- 12 character line (EM Rule —) -->  
————————————
   
The listing comma is used as a kind of substitute for the word '`and`', or sometimes for '`or`'. It
occurs in two slightly different circumstances.

1. **In a list with three or more elements**; call this construction an *x, y, and z list*:  
`The Three Musketeers were Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.`

Observe that you can connect three or more complete sentences with listing commas. Note the
difference here:

* `Lisa speaks French, Juliet speaks Italian, and I speak Spanish.`
* `*Lisa speaks French, Juliet speaks Italian.`

Remember, **you must not join two complete sentences with a comma**, but three or more complete
sentences may be joined with listing commas plus '`and`' or '`or`'.

2. **In a list of modifiers which all modify the same thing**. 

* `This is a provocative, disturbing book.`
* `Her long, dark, glossy hair fascinated me.`

This time there will usually be no '`and`' present at all, but again such a comma could be replaced
by '`and`' without destroying the sense:

* `This is a provocative and disturbing book.`
* `Her long and dark and glossy hair fascinated me.`

The sense is unchanged, though the second example, at least, is much clumsier without the commas.

Observe the difference in the next two examples:

* `She gave me an antique ivory box.`
* `I prefer Australian red wines to all others.`

It would be wrong to write

* `*She gave me an antique, ivory box.`
* `*I prefer Australian, red wines to all others.`

Why the difference? In these examples, a listing comma cannot be used because there is no list: the
word '`and`' cannot possibly be inserted.

* `*She gave me an antique and ivory box.`
* `*I prefer Australian and red wines to all others.`

The reason for the difference is that the modifiers this time do not modify the same thing. In the
first example, *antique* modifies *ivory box*, not just *box*. In the second example, *Australian*
modifies *red wines*, not just *wines*.


### 3.2 The Joining Comma

**Summary**

* Typically '`and`', '`but`', '`or`', '`while`', and '`yet`' are acceptable after a *joining* comma

    - e.g. `You must hand in your essay by Friday, or you will receive a mark of zero.`
  
* Most other connecting words **cannot** be preceded by a *joining* comma
  
    - e.g. '`however`', '`therefore`', '`hence`', '`consequently`', '`nevertheless`', and '`thus`' 
      **cannot** be used after a joining comma

* Note that there are words commonly used after a 'bracketing' comma, e.g. `because` and `since` but
  not after a 'joining' comma

<!-- 12 character line (EM Rule —) -->  
————————————

**The joining comma** is used to join two complete sentences into a single sentence, and it **must
  be followed by a suitable connecting word.** The connecting words which are usually used in this
  way are '`and`', '`but`', '`or`', '`while`', and '`yet`'. Most other connecting words cannot be
  preceded by a joining comma. For example, the connecting words '`however`', '`therefore`', 
  '`hence`', '`consequently`', '`nevertheless`', and '`thus`' **cannot** be used after a joining 
  comma.

[Note that there are words commonly used after a 'bracketing' comma, but not after a 'joining' comma]

```

ALL THESE SENTENCES ARE INCORRECT

*Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries, its annual income is only $80 per person.
*The British are notoriously bad at learning foreign languages, the Dutch are famously good at it.
*The proposal to introduce rock music to Radio 3 has caused an outcry, angry letters have been
 pouring into the BBC.
*Borg won his fifth straight Wimbledon title in 1980, the following year he lost in the final to
 McEnroe.

[The sentences below use the wrong connecting words after the comma]

*Saturn was long thought to be the only ringed planet, however, this is now known not to be the case.
*Two members of the expedition were too ill to continue, nevertheless the others decided to press on.
*Liverpool are five points behind the leaders, therefore they must win both their remaining games.

```


### 3.3 The Gapping Comma

The gapping comma is used to show that one or more words have been left out when the missing words
would simply repeat the words already used earlier in the same sentence.

* `Some Norwegians wanted to base their national language on the speech of the capital city; others,
  on the speech of the rural countryside.`

The gapping comma here shows that the words *wanted to base their national language*, which might
have been repeated, have instead been omitted.

This sentence is equivalent to a longer sentence like this:

* `Some Norwegians wanted to base their national language on the speech of the capital city; others
  wanted to base it on the speech of the rural countryside.`

Use your judgement: if a sentence seems clear without gapping commas, don't use them; if you have
doubts, put them in. 


### 3.4 Bracketing Commas

**Summary**

* A **pair** of bracketing commas is used to mark off a weak interruption of the sentence—that is,
  an interruption which does not disturb the smooth flow of the sentence. (Bracketing commas, in
  principle at least, always occur in pairs, though sometimes one of them is not written.)

* If the interruption comes at the beginning or the end of the sentence, use only one bracketing
  comma

* Make sure the words set off are really an interruption. (If you have set off some words with a
  pair of bracketing commas, and you find you can't remove those words without destroying the
  sentence, you have done something wrong.)

* There are a number of common words which typically introduce weak interruptions containing
  complete sentences. Among the commonest of these are '`although`', '`though`', '`even though`', 
  '`because`', '`since`', '`after`', '`before`', '`if`', '`when`', and '`whenever`'
  
* A restrictive clause is required to identify what is being talked about, and it never receives
  bracketing commas
  
    - `The European powers that were busily carving up Africa paid no attention to the boundaries
      between rival ethnic groups.` [Restricts the talk to only the European powers that were
      busily carving up Africa.]
  
    - `The Russian scholar Yuri Knorosov has provided an interpretation of the Mayan inscriptions
      which is now generally accepted.`

* A non-restrictive clause is not required for identification, but only adds further information,
  and it always receives bracketing commas
    
    -  `The European powers, which were busily carving up Africa, paid no attention to the
       boundaries between rival ethnic groups.` [Without restriction talks about all European
       powers, and it adds a little information about what they were doing]

    - `Margaret Thatcher, who hated trains, refused to consider privatizing the railways.`

————————————

Bracketing commas (also called isolating commas) do a very different job from the other three types.
These are the most frequently used type of comma, and they cause more problems than the other types
put together. 

The rule is this: a pair of bracketing commas is used to mark off a weak interruption of the
sentence—that is, an interruption which does not disturb the smooth flow of the sentence.
Bracketing commas, in principle at least, always occur in pairs, though sometimes one of them is
not written, as explained below. 

Sometimes a weak interruption comes at the beginning or at the end of its sentence. In such a case,
one of the two bracketing commas would logically fall at the beginning or the end of the sentence —
but we never write a comma at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. As a result, only one of
the two bracketing commas is written in this case. All these examples are correct:

* `All in all, I think we can say that we've done well.`
* `I think we can say that we've done well, all in all.`
* `I think we can say that, all in all, we've done well.`

#### Example 1

* `These findings, we would suggest, cast doubt upon his hypothesis.`
* `Schliemann, of course, did his digging before modern archaeology was invented.`

Notice something important: in every one of these examples, the weak interruption set off by
bracketing commas could, in principle, be removed from the sentence, and the result would still be
a complete sentence that made good sense. Try this with some of the examples:

* `These findings cast doubt upon his hypothesis.`
* `Schliemann did his digging before modern archaeology was invented.`

This is *always* the case with bracketing commas, and it gives you a simple way of checking your
punctuation. If you have set off some words with a pair of bracketing commas, and you find you
can't remove those words without destroying the sentence, you have done something wrong.

#### Example 2

Here is an example of wrong use [Carey (1958)]:

`*Yet, outside that door, lay a whole new world.`

If you try to remove the words "`outside that door`", the result is `*Yet lay a whole new world`,
which is not a sentence. "`Outside that door`" is not an interruption at all: it's an essential
part of the sentence. So, the bracketing commas shouldn't be there. Just get rid of them: `Yet
outside that door lay a whole new world.`

#### Example 3

`*Stanley was a determined, even ruthless figure.`

What's wrong here? Well, that comma can't possibly be a listing comma, a joining comma, or a gapping
comma; therefore it must be intended as a bracketing comma. But where is the interruption it is
trying to bracket? It can't be the three words at the end: `*Stanley was a determined` is so much
gibberish.

In fact, the weak interruption here is the phrase *even ruthless*, and the bracketing commas should
show this: `Stanley was a determined, even ruthless, figure`. Now the bracketed interruption can be
safely removed: `Stanley was a determined figure.`

#### Example 4

`*The Third Partition of Poland was the last, and undoubtedly the most humiliating act in the sorry
decline of the once-powerful kingdom.`

Here the sequence before the comma, *The Third Partition of Poland was the last*, seems to make
sense by itself, but unfortunately not the sense that the writer intends.

With only one comma, the reader will surely assume the writer means "`The Third Partition of Poland
was the last [partition of Poland]`". Then, the reader will go on to assume that the word 
'undoubtedly' begins another statement and will be left floundering when she abruptly comes to
a full stop instead of a verb.

The essential second bracketing comma removes the problem:

`The Third Partition of Poland was the last, and undoubtedly the most humiliating, act in the sorry
decline of the once-powerful kingdom`

Here it is clarified that it was the last act, and that it was the most humiliating.

#### Example 5

Here is another example of a type which often causes trouble:

`The people of Cornwall, who depend upon fishing for their livelihood, are up in arms over the new
EC quotas.`

We could in principle remove the bracketed interruption to produce a sensible sentence:

`The people of Cornwall are up in arms over the new EC quotas.`

But note carefully: this sentence is talking about *all* the people of Cornwall, and not just some
of them, and hence so was the original sentence. The weak interruption in the original sentence is
merely adding some extra information about the people of Cornwall.

Now consider this different example:

`The people of Cornwall who depend upon fishing for their livelihood are up in arms over the new EC
quotas.`

Now we are not talking about all the people of Cornwall, but *only about some of them*:
specifically, about the ones who depend upon fishing for their livelihood.

#### Example 6

There are a number of common words which typically introduce weak interruptions containing complete
sentences. Among the commonest of these are '`although`', '`though`', '`even though`', '`because`', 
'`since`', '`after`', '`before`', '`if`', '`when`', and '`whenever`'.

* `Although Australian wines are a fairly new phenomenon, they have already established a formidable
  reputation.`

* `After the Roman legions withdrew from Britain, the British found themselves defenceless against
  Irish and Viking raids.`

* `If there are any further cuts in funding, our library will be severely affected.`

* `Columbus is usually credited with discovering America, even though the Vikings had preceded him
  by several centuries.`

* `Hitler could never have invaded Britain successfully, because their excellent rail system would
  have allowed the British to mass defenders quickly at any beachhead.`

[Note that there is a comma before because, although it doesn't seem quite right in this example]

#### Example 7: be careful

Lesson: **when you are checking your bracketing commas, make sure that the words enclosed in commas
really do make up an interruption, and do not include an essential part of the sentence**.

Consider the following example, and try to decide if the comma is properly used:

* `Note that in each of these examples, the material set off by commas could be removed without
  destroying the sentence.`

Is this a bracketing comma? Try removing the words before the comma. The material set off by commas
could be removed without destroying the sentence. This appears to be a good sentence, and so you
might think that the original example was correctly punctuated. But it is not. 

The problem is that the original sentence was an instruction to notice something, and the words
'`Note that`' are therefore an essential part of the sentence, not part of the interruption. The
interruption, quite clearly, consists only of the words '`in each of these examples`'.

When we tried to remove the first seven words, we got something that was a sentence, purely by
accident, but a sentence in which the original meaning had been partly destroyed. The original
attempt at punctuating was therefore wrong, and it must be corrected by adding the second
bracketing comma around the interruption.

* `Note that, in each of these examples, the material set off by commas could be removed without
  destroying the sentence.`

Now the interruption marked off by the bracketing commas can be safely removed without wrecking the
sense of the sentence:

* `Note that the material set off by commas could be removed without destroying the sentence.`

#### Example 8

In many cases a weak interruption does not absolutely require bracketing commas. Thus either of the
following is fine

* `Shortly before the war, he was living in Paris.`
* `Shortly before the war he was living in Paris.`

With or without the bracketing comma, this sentence is perfectly clear.

Sometimes, however, the bracketing comma is absolutely essential to avoid misleading the reader:

* `*Just before unloading the trucks were fired upon.`

Here the reader naturally takes "`Just before unloading the trucks`" as a single phrase, and is left
floundering as a result. A bracketing comma removes the difficulty:  
"`Just before unloading, the trucks were fired upon.`"

<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
### Restrictive and Non-restrictive Clauses

The difference illustrated by the last two examples is the difference between what are called
restrictive (or defining) relative clauses and non-restrictive (or non-defining) relative clauses.
**A restrictive clause is required to identify what is being talked about, and it never receives
bracketing commas. A non-restrictive clause is not required for identification, but only adds
further information, and it always receives bracketing commas**. Here are some further examples of
the difference. 

Some **non-restrictive clauses**:

* `Margaret Thatcher, who hated trains, refused to consider privatizing the railways.`

*  `The European powers, which were busily carving up Africa, paid no attention to the boundaries
   between rival ethnic groups.` [Without restriction talks about all European powers, and it adds
   a little information about what they were doing.]

Some **restrictive clauses**:

* `The European powers that were busily carving up Africa paid no attention to the boundaries
  between rival ethnic groups.` [Restricts the talk to only the European powers that were busily
  carving up Africa.]
  
#### 'that' and 'which'

Finally, note that the word '`that`' can only introduce a restrictive clause, and so a relative
clause with '`that`' can never take bracketing commas:

* `*The European powers, that were busily carving up Africa, paid no attention to the boundaries
  between rival ethnic groups.`[Wrong]

If this relative clause is intended to identify the specific European powers under discussion, then
the commas should be removed; if, however, the sentence is meant to be about the European powers
generally, the commas are correct but the *that* must be changed to *which*.

* `The European powers that were busily carving up Africa paid no attention to the boundaries
  between rival ethnic groups.` [Restricts the talk to only the European powers that were busily
  carving up Africa.]

* `The European powers, which were busily carving up Africa, paid no attention to the boundaries
  between rival ethnic groups.` [Without restriction talks about all European powers, and it adds a
  little information about what they were doing.]

#### commas and restrictive clauses with proper names

Observe that a proper name always uniquely identifies the person or thing being talked about, and
hence a proper name never receives a restrictive clause (with no commas) in normal circumstances:  
`*I discussed this with Johanna Nichols who is a specialist in Caucasian languages.`

Here the clause following the proper name *Johanna Nichols* must be set off by a bracketing comma. 

The only exception is the special case in which a proper name is preceded by '`the`' to indicate
that we are talking about some particular stage in time:  
`The Napoleon who retreated from Moscow was a sadder and wiser man than the Napoleon who had
previously known only unbroken triumph.`


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## Chapter 4: The Colon and the Semicolon

### 4.1 The colon (`:`)

The colon (`:`) is used to indicate that what follows it is an explanation or elaboration of what
precedes it. That is, having introduced some topic in more general terms, you can use a colon and
go on to explain that same topic in more specific terms. Schematically: `More general: more
specific`.

* The colon is never preceded by a white space. It is always followed by a single white space in
  normal use. It is never, never, never followed by a hyphen or a dash

* A colon is nearly always preceded by a complete sentence; what follows the colon may or may not be
  a complete sentence, and it may be a mere list or even a single word

* A colon is not normally followed by a capital letter in British usage, though American usage often
  prefers to use a capital

#### Examples

* `Africa is facing a terrifying problem: perpetual drought.  [Explains what the problem is.]`

* `Mae West had one golden rule for handling men: 'Tell the pretty ones they're smart and tell the
  smart ones they're pretty.' [Explicates the golden rule.]`

* `We found the place easily: your directions were perfect. [Explains why we found it easily.]`

* `I propose the creation of a new post: School Executive Officer. [Identifies the post in
  question.]`

The colon has a few minor uses. 

First, when you cite the name of a book which has both a title and a subtitle, you should separate
the two with a colon: `I recommend Chinnery's book "Oak Furniture: The British Tradition."`. You
should do this even though no colon may appear on the cover or the title page of the book itself.

Second, the colon is used in citing passages from the Bible: `The story of Menahem is found in II
Kings 15:14-22.`

Third, the colon may be used in writing ratios: `Among students of French, women outnumber men by
more than 4:1.`

In formal writing, however, it is usually preferable to write out ratios in words: `Among students
of French, women outnumber men by more than four to one.`


### 4.2 The Semicolon (`;`)

**Summary**

The semicolon has only one major use. It is used to join two complete sentences into a single
written sentence when all of the following conditions are met:

1. The two sentences are felt to be too closely related to be separated by a full stop
2. There is no connecting word which would require a comma, such as 'and' or 'but'
3. The special conditions requiring a colon are absent

* That certain connecting words require a preceding semicolon; chief among these are '`however`', 
  '`therefore`', '`hence`', '`thus`', '`consequently`', '`nevertheless`', and '`meanwhile`'

* There is one special circumstance in which a semicolon may be used to separate sequences which are
  not complete sentences. This occurs when a sentence has become so long and so full of commas that
  the reader can hardly be expected to follow it without some special marking

————————————

Here is a famous example: "`It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.`"

A semicolon can always, in principle, be replaced either by a full stop (yielding two separate
sentences) or by the word 'and' (possibly preceded by a joining comma). Thus Dickens might have
written: "`It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.`", or "`It was the best of times,
and it was the worst of times.`"

The use of the semicolon suggests that the writer sees the two smaller sentences as being more
closely related than the average two consecutive sentences; preferring the semicolon to the
word '`and`' often gives a more vivid sense of the relation between the two.

But observe carefully: the semicolon must be both preceded by a complete sentence and followed by a
complete sentence. Do not use the semicolon otherwise

Here are some further examples of correct use:

* `Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937; the first volume of The Lord of the Rings followed in 1954.`

* `The Cabernet Sauvignon grape predominates in the Bordeaux region; Pinot Noir holds sway in
  Burgundy; Syrah is largely confined to the Rhone valley.`

#### Error: semicolon not separating complete sentences

These are all wrong, since in these examples the semicolon is not separating complete sentences. 

```

*I don't like him; not at all.
*In 1991 the music world was shaken by a tragic event; the death of Freddy Mercury.
*We've had streams of books on chaos theory; no fewer than twelve since 1988.
*After a long and bitter struggle; Derrida was awarded an honorary degree by Cambridge
  University.
  
(The first and last of these should have only a bracketing comma, while the second and third meet
the requirements for a colon and should have one.)

```

#### Connecting Words Used with Semicolon

Note that certain connecting words require a preceding semicolon; chief among these
are '`however`', '`therefore`', '`hence`', '`thus`', '`consequently`', '`nevertheless`',
and '`meanwhile`'.

    - `Saturn was long thought to be the only ringed planet; however, this is now known not to be
      the case.`

    - `The two warring sides have refused to withdraw from the airport; consequently aid flights
      have had to be suspended.`

Observe that in these examples the sequence after the semicolon *does* constitute a complete
sentence. And note particularly that the word however must be separated by a semicolon (or a full
stop) from a preceding complete sentence; this is a very common mistake.

#### Special Circumstance

There is one special circumstance in which a semicolon may be used to separate sequences which are
not complete sentences. This occurs when a sentence has become so long and so full of commas that
the reader can hardly be expected to follow it without some special marking.

In this case, we sometimes find semicolons used instead of commas to mark the most important breaks
in the sentence: such semicolons are effectively being used to mark places where the reader can
pause to catch her breath.

Consider the following example:

```

In Somalia, where the civil war still rages, western aid workers, in spite of frantic efforts, are
unable to operate, and the people, starving, terrified and desperate, are flooding into
neighbouring Ethiopia.

```

This sentence is perfectly punctuated, but the number of commas is somewhat alarming. In such a
case, the comma marking the major break in the sentence may be replaced by a semicolon:

```

In Somalia, where the civil war still rages, western aid workers, in spite of frantic efforts, are
unable to operate; and the people, starving, terrified and desperate, are flooding into
neighbouring Ethiopia.

```

Such use of the semicolon as a kind of 'super-comma' is not very appealing, and you should do your
best to avoid it.

If you find one of your sentences becoming dangerously long and full of commas, it is usually better
to start over and rewrite it, perhaps as two separate sentences:

```

In Somalia, where the civil war still rages, western aid workers, in spite of frantic efforts, are
unable to operate. Meanwhile the people, starving, terrified and desperate, are flooding into
neighbouring Ethiopia. 

```

### 4.3 The Colon and the Semicolon Compared

#### Example 1

`Lisa is upset. Gus is having a nervous breakdown.`

The use of two separate sentences suggests that there is no particular connection between these two
facts: they just happen to be true at the same time. No particular inference can be drawn, except
perhaps that things are generally bad.

Now see what happens when a semicolon is used: `Lisa is upset; Gus is having a nervous breakdown.`

The semicolon now suggests that the two statements are related in some way. The likeliest inference
is that the cause of Lisa's annoyance and the cause of Gus's nervous breakdown are the same.
Perhaps, for example, both are being disturbed by building noise next door. (Remember, a semicolon
connects two sentences which are related.)

Now try it with a colon: `Lisa is upset: Gus is having a nervous breakdown.`

This time the colon shows explicitly that Gus's nervous breakdown is the reason for Lisa's distress:
Lisa is upset because Gus is having a nervous breakdown. (Remember, a colon introduces an
explanation or elaboration of what has come before.)

#### Example 2

Consider another example: `I have the answer. Mike's solution doesn't work.`

Here we have two independent statements: my answer and Mike's solution may possibly have been
directed at the same problem, but nothing implies this, and equally they may have been directed at
two entirely distinct problems.

Now, with a semicolon: `I have the answer; Mike's solution doesn't work.`

The semicolon shows that the two statements are related, and strongly implies that Mike and I were
working on the same problem. 

Finally, with a colon: `I have the answer: Mike's solution doesn't work.`

This time the use of the colon indicates that the failure of Mike's solution is exactly the answer
which I have obtained: that is, what I have discovered is that Mike's solution doesn't work.

If you understand these examples, you should be well on your way to using colons and semicolons
correctly.

## Chapter 5: The Apostrophe (`'`)

<!-- page 49 -->

It is a blunt fact that the incorrect use of apostrophes will make your writing look illiterate more
quickly than almost any other kind of mistake.

### 5.1 Contractions

The apostrophe is used in writing contractions — that is, shortened forms of words from which one or
more letters have been omitted.

Here are some of the commonest examples, with their uncontracted equivalents:

```

it's     -- "it is" or "it has"
we'll    -- "we will" or "we shall"
they've  -- "they have"
can't    -- "can not"
he'd     -- "he would" or "he had"
aren't   -- "are not"
she'd've -- "she would have"
won't    -- "will not"

```

Note in each case that the apostrophe appears precisely in the position of the omitted letters: we
write `can't` , not  `*ca'nt` , and `aren't`, not  `*are'nt`.

Note also that the irregular contraction '`won't`' takes its apostrophe between the `n` and the `t`,
just like all other contractions involving `not`.

It is not wrong to use such contractions in formal writing, but you should use them sparingly, since
they tend to make your writing appear less than fully formal. 


### 5.2 Unusual Plurals

**As a general rule, we never use an apostrophe in writing plural forms**. 

Hence the things that those shops are selling are pizzas, videos, and fine wines. It is absolutely
wrong to write  `*pizza's`,  `*video's`, and `*fine wine's`  if you merely want to talk about more
than one pizza or video or whatever.

The same goes even when you want to pluralize a proper name:

```

She's trying to keep up with the Joneses.
There are four Steves and three Julies in my class.

```

Do not write things like `*Jones's`,  `*Steve's`, or `*Julie's` if you are merely talking about more
than one person or thing with that name.

An apostrophe is indispensable, however, in the rare case in which you need to pluralize a letter of
the alphabet or some other unusual form which would become unrecognizable with a plural ending
stuck on it:

```

How many s's are there in Mississippi ?
It is very bad style to spatter e.g.'s and i.e.'s through your writing.

```


### 5.3 Possessives

An apostrophe is used in a possessive form, like "`Esther's family`" or "`Janet's cigarettes`", and
this is the use of the apostrophe which causes most of the trouble. 

**The basic rule is simple enough: a possessive form is spelled with `'s` at the end.**

Hence: `Lisa's essay`, `England's navy`, `my brother's girlfriend`, `Wittgenstein's last book`

This rule applies in most cases (even with a name ending in `s`): `Thomas's job`, `the bus's
arrival`, `James's fiancee`

**There are three types of exception.**

1. a plural noun which already ends in `s` takes only a following apostrophe. (We don't pronounce
these words with two esses, and so we don't write two esses; nobody says "`*the girls's
excitement`".)

    * `the girls' excitement`, `my parents' wedding`, `both players' injuries`, `two weeks' work`

But note that plurals that don't end in `s` take the ordinary form [as in '`children's shoes`'
and '`women's clothing`'].

2. A name ending in `s` takes an apostrophe only if the possessive form is not pronounced with an
extra `s`.

    * `Socrates' philosophy`, `Saint Saens' music`, `Ulysses' companions`, `Aristophanes' plays`

3. Pronouns never have apostrophes: `He lost his book`, `Which seats are ours?`, `The bull lowered
its head`, `Whose are these spectacles?`

    * Note in particular the spelling of possessive '`its`'. This word never takes an apostrophe:
      `*The bull lowered it's head`. There is an English word spelled '`it's`', of course, but this
      is not a possessive: it's the contracted form of '`it is`' or of '`it has`'.

    * The same goes for the possessive '`whose`': it cannot be spelled as '`*who's`', though, again,
      there is a word '`who's`', a contraction of '`who is`' or of '`who has`', as in '`Who's your
      friend?`' or '`Who's got a corkscrew?`'

    * Note, however, that the indefinite pronoun '`one`' forms an ordinary possessive '`one's`', as
      in "`One must choose one's words carefully`".

<!--  -->

There is a further point about writing possessives: 

When you add `'s`, or an apostrophe alone to form a possessive, the thing that comes before the
apostrophe must be a real English word, and it must also be the right English word. 
  
  * something like "`*ladie's shoes`" is impossible, because there is no such word as '`ladie`'. 

  * a department in a shoeshop could not be called "`*lady's shoes`", because what the shop is
    selling is shoes for ladies, and not "`shoes for lady`". The correct form is `ladies' shoes`.
    (In another case, if you were talking about the shoes that a particular lady is wearing you
    could say "`look at that lady's shoes`".)

## Chapter 6: The Hyphen and the Dash

### The Hyphen (`-`)

It is the small bar found on every keyboard (`U+002D`)

* The hyphen must never be used with white spaces at both ends, though in some uses it may have a
  white space at one end.

* It is used to show that what it is attached to does not make up a complete word by itself.

* A hyphen is also used to indicate that a long word has been broken off at the end of a line.
  (You should avoid such word splitting whenever possible. If it is unavoidable, try to split the
  word into two roughly equal parts, and make sure you split it at an obvious boundary. )

* The hyphen is also used in writing compound words which, without the hyphen, would be ambiguous,
  hard to read, or overly long.
  
* There are three cases in which a hyphen is absolutely required after a prefix: 

    - If a capital letter or a numeral follows: `pre-Newtonian physics`
    
    - If the prefix is added to a word which already contains a hyphen: `non-bribe-taking
      politicians`
    
    - If the prefix is added to a compound word containing a white space. In this case, the white
      space itself must be replaced by a hyphen to prevent the prefixed word from becoming
      unreadable: `"twentieth century" --> "pre-twentieth-century music"`

Here, more than anywhere else in the whole field of punctuation, there is room for individual taste
and judgement; nevertheless, certain principles may be identified.

These are:

1. Above all, strive for clarity
2. Don't use a hyphen unless it's necessary
3. Where possible, follow established usage

Should you write land owners, land-owners or landowners? All are possible, and you should follow
your judgement, and British usage generally favours rather more hyphens here than does American
usage; nevertheless, I prefer the third, since it seems unambiguous and easy to read, since it
avoids the use of a hyphen, and since this form is confirmed by Longman and Collins as the usual
one.

————————————

#### Names

The hyphen is regularly used in writing so-called 'doublebarrelled' names: `Jose-Maria Olazabal`,
`Jean-Paul Gaultier`. However, some individuals with such names prefer to omit the hyphen: `Jean
Paul Sartre`, `Hillary Rodham Clinton`. You should always respect the usage of the owner of the
name.

<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
#### Compound Modifiers

Now here is something important: it is usually essential to hyphenate compound modifiers.

##### Examples 

Compare the following:

* `She kissed him good night.`
* `She gave him a good-night kiss.`

The hyphen in the second example is necessary to show that good-night is a single compound modifier.
Without the hyphen, the reader might easily be misled: `*She gave him a good night kiss.` Here the
reader might be momentarily flummoxed into thinking that she had given him some kind of '`night
kiss`', whatever that means. 

Here are some further examples:

* `Her dress is light green. --> She's wearing a light-green dress.`

* `This book token is worth ten pounds. --> This is a ten-pound book token.`

* `Her son is ten years old. --> She has a ten-year-old son.`

Use hyphens liberally in such compound modifiers; they are often vital to comprehension:

* "`a rusty-nail cutter`" is hardly the same as a "`rusty nail-cutter`"
* "`a woman-hating religion`" is utterly different from a "`woman hating religion`"

##### Another Example

Compare: 

* `The earliest known hominid was Homo habilis.`
* `The earliest-known hominid was Homo habilis.`

The first means that, of all the hominids we know about, Homo habilis was the earliest one to exist.
The second means that, of all the hominids, Homo Habilis was the first one we knew about. 

Effectively, the first sentence includes the structure [earliest] [known hominid], while the second
includes the structure [earliest-known] [hominid].

These two sentences would be pronounced differently, but the pronunciation difference is lost in
writing; hence accurate punctuation is essential if you are not going to mislead your reader
utterly. (As it happens, the first statement is true, but the second one is false.)

<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
#### Prefixes

Prefixes present special problems

* "`She re-covered the sofa`" [= "`She put a new cover on the sofa`"] is absolutely essential to
   avoid confusion with the entirely different 

* "`She recovered the sofa`" [= "`She got the sofa back`"].

A prefix must not be written as though it were a separate word. Thus all the following are wrong:

```

*post war period
*mini computer
*non communist countries
*anti vivisectionists

```

**There are three cases in which a hyphen is absolutely required after a prefix.**

1. If a capital letter or a numeral follows:

```

non-EC countries
pre-Newtonian physics
post-Napoleonic Europe
un-American activities
anti-French feeling
pre-1500 English literature

```

2. If the prefix is added to a word which already contains a hyphen:

```

non-bribe-taking politicians
non-stress-timed languages
his pre-globe-trotting days
an un-re-elected politician

```

Your reader cannot be expected to take in at a glance some indigestible glob like 
"`*his preglobe-trotting days`" or "`*an unre-elected politician`".

3. If the prefix is added to a compound word containing a white space. In this case, the white space
itself must be replaced by a hyphen to prevent the prefixed word from becoming unreadable:

```

"seal killing" but "anti-seal-killing campaigners"
"twentieth century" but "pre-twentieth-century music"
"cold war" but our "post-cold-war world"

```

### 6.2 The dash (`—`) 

The dash (`—`) is the long horizontal bar, noticeably longer than a hyphen; it is also called an
em-rule (`U+2014`).

* The dash has only one major use: a pair of dashes separates a strong interruption from the rest of
  the sentence. (Note that word 'pair': in principle, at least, dashes come in pairs, though
  sometimes one of them is not written.) 

* Oxford style says no spaces between dashes.

* Use the dash carefully: overuse of dashes will give your writing a breathless and disjointed
  appearance. And don't use a dash for any purpose other than setting off a strong interruption or
  marking a range: the dash is never used in place of a hyphen, after a colon, or after a heading.
  
Here are some examples:

```

An honest politician—if such a creature exists—would never agree to such a plan.

The destruction of Guernica—and there is no doubt that the destruction was deliberate—horrified the
world.

When the Europeans settled in Tasmania, they inflicted genocide—there is no other word for it—upon
the indigenous population, who were wiped out in thirty years.

The Serbs want peace—or so they say. 
[Here only one dash is used since the interruption is at the end]

```
