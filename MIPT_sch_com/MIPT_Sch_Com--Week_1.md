# Week 1, Part 1: Conventions

## 1.1 - Writing in English

> "Every language is a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained
   the forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but also analyzes
   nature, notices or neglects types of relationship and phenomena, channels his reasoning, and
   builds the house of his consciousness." — Benjamin Lee Whorf

In the global age, English is an academic *lingua franca*, an international means of communication
of native speakers of other languages. English dominates in higher education and research,
effectively facilitating the free exchange of knowledge. 

Statistics show that more than 90% of the world's population now speak English with reasonable
competence. This growth has been at the expense of other languages, so that now the majority of
International Scientific Journals they are in English and the most prestigious inside the journals
are in English.

Countless students at academics they now have to gain fluency in the conventions of English language
academic discourse to understand their disciplines and to establish their careers. At first glance,
writing in English should not be difficult: you have studied English at school, you watch films,
you read books, you travel to other countries—some of you may even discuss complex issues at
international conferences. So why is writing in English, and in particular, writing research papers
in English so hard? You speak a native language and the level of your English is presumably high,
but this transfer can be visible in writing, which is not a good thing for efficient scientific
writing in English.

According to American applied-linguist, Robert Kaplan, logic, which is the basis of rhetoric,
evolves out of culture, which means that a person's first language and culture influences his or
her writing in a second language. Robert Kaplan argues that text for production and rhetorical
organization are related. *Contrastive rhetoric hypothesis* assumes that the culture, ethnicity,
language, and nation are mapped onto one another in a monolithic, heterogeneous and mutually
determining kind of way. Thus the Japanese, the Arabs, the Spanish, the Russians, whoever, write
the way they do because they think the way they do—and this way is different from English. 

These are five cultural-specific discourse patterns; these are the ways how different cultures
present information in the written text.

Kaplan published the results of his analysis of about 600 paragraphs of expository English essays
written by speakers of Arabic, Korean, Chinese, French, Spanish and Russian which showed
considerable difference of discourse patterns, determined by cultural specificity. He summed up the
results of his comparative analysis in the following figure:

* **Semitic pattern**: characterized by parallel constructions and comparisons. Long sentences and
    the use of conjunctions are typical features of this discourse pattern.

* **Oriental discourse pattern**: the topics may start far away in an unrelated area, and the
    outside information adds the meaning to the written text.

* **Romance (Latin)**: uses a lot of digressions and metaphors. The language is highly more defined
    by adjectives and adverbs.

* **Russian pattern**: very similar to Latin—we love metaphors and we love decorations, and the
    sentences are even longer. And certainly we modify the language by adverbs and adjectives.

* **English pattern**: direct, clear, sequential and very straightforward. English is economical.
    The sentences are much shorter. The paragraphs are much shorter. And the information is
    presented directly to the reader. Simply put, English is different. But the difference I'm
    speaking does not concern English language, but the rhetorical conventions of English speaking
    countries, and these conventions, they have unwritten rules of which I'm going to speak in the
    next lesson.

## 1.2 - Anglo-American Rhetorical Traditions

```

rhetor | ˈriːtə |
noun
(in ancient Greece and Rome) a teacher of rhetoric.
* an orator.

rhetoric | ˈrɛtərɪk |
noun [mass noun]
the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the exploitation of figures of
speech and other compositional techniques: he is using a common figure of rhetoric, hyperbole.

```

The historical conventions of English contain a series of unspoken rules, the most important of
which is that the writer does all the job and the reader is spoon-fed all the information: the
writer presents the information in such a way that the reader simply absorbs this information and
considers and receives clear writing, not trying to struggle with the words, decoding their
meaning.

The concept of writer responsibility does not apply to all cultures. In Chinese and Japanese, for
example, readers play a very important role in considering all the data and observations. In other
words, Chinese and Japanese are reader-responsible languages. The rhetorical traditions of most
European countries fall between these two extremes. And these traditions cause the reader to
participate more actively following the train thought of the writer through unframed digressions
and anecdotes that the writer may present.

In English, the writer cannot just take an idea or some words of a scholar and put these ideas or
these words in a paragraph without no explanation why this idea or why this concept is put in this
particular paragraph and not three pages later. The writer has to explain why he or she considers
that this theory or this concept should be explained in this particular section, in this paragraph,
and not elsewhere.

English rhetorical conventions are based on Aristotelian logic. In English, a writer does not only
have to prove the point, because Aristotelian logic is based on proof and very solid evidence, the
writer has to say that he or she has proved this point and how he or she has done this.

First, the writer presents the paper by letting the reader know what the paper is going to cover.
Next, the writer covers what he or she has promised to cover. And then by pooling all the minor
conclusions into one clear conclusion, presents the point. It is important that the writer shows
that he has proved the point and how he has done so.

Not surprisingly, for all the rhetorical conventions, English has the most linear approach with the
beginning, the middle, the end. Each following clearly, precisely, directly from the other. English
demands an arrow like trajectory: the writer targets at the conclusion and goes ahead, looking
neither to the left nor to the right.

## 1.3 Golden Rules Scientific Writing

> "The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking." — Albert Einstein

You certainly have ideas about writing that you take for granted and assume to be universal. As the
primary goal of this course is to help you get published in higher ranked international journals,
our aim is to shake the foundations of the unconscious assumptions that get in the way of your
writing. We show you Anglo-American Rhetorical conventions, which may be different from your own.

From different sources, I [Elena Bazanova] unmasked a collection of golden rules. Unwritten rules of
scientific writing that you should always keep in the back of your mind whenever you get down to
writing your research paper.

### Unwritten rules of scientific writing

1. Be clear, precise and focused as much as possible without sacrificing the meaning of your
writing.

2. Keep your sentences and paragraphs reasonably short. Remember less is more.

3. Avoid unnecessary jargon.

4. Use personal pronouns 'I' and 'We' for self-promotion.

5. Frame and contexualize whatever you are writing.

6. Let your reader know what you're writing about and why you're writing about this.

7. Define your terms, immediately after you first mentioned them.

[As taught by Elena Bazanova (Director of the Language Training and Testing Center at MIPT)]

### Simplicity

"Simplicity is the heart of efficient scientific writing. The secret of good writing is to reduce
 every sentence to its clearest component. Remove every word that has no function, every long word
 that can be short, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every
 construction that makes the reader unsure of what is happening or what you're describing, every
 pronoun that is misplaced, the misused of a tense. Simplify, otherwise you will lose your reader;
 not because readers are stupid or too lazy to follow your train of your thought but because, if
 they are working too hard on trying to crack the meaning of your writing, they will probably just
 move on to find a better paper. Complex writing will be a drain on enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is
 what keeps the reader involved. Every piece of successful scholarly writing should have only one
 provocative thought that your reader did not have before; not two, not five, only one." — Elena
 Bazanova, Director of the Language Training and Testing Center Moscow Institute of Physics and
 Technology [Based on a quote by William Zinsser, and possibly other sources]
   
"The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that
 serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same
 meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of
 who is doing what— these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a
 sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank." — William Zinsser

# Week 1, Part 2: Clarity of Thought

## 1.4 - Clarity, Precision, Accuracy

> "State your facts as simply as possible, even boldly. No one wants flowers of eloquence or
   literary ornaments in a research title." — R.B. McKerrow.

All writing, ultimately, is a question of solving your problem. It may be a question of finding the
facts of presenting your paper. It may be a question of attitude, style, or tone. Whatever it is,
it has to be clear, precise, and accurate.

For a scientist, to write in a compact way is an act of success or maybe, survival. When your areas
are unclear and sentences cluttered and the information is excessive, all those things can get your
reader confused or frustrated.

Most scientific journals require a limited amount of pages. For example, the National Science
Foundation will not look at the proposals which are longer than 15 pages. If your paper is longer,
then you will need to squeeze down into the required amount of pages. There are certain strategies
that you can apply when you start writing your paper.

Roy Peter Clark, an American writer, editor and teacher of academic writing, puts it this way: prune
the big limbs and shake out all the bad leaves ... precision comes from selection not from
compression.

There are different strategies how you can compress your paper, how you can make it condensed. Prune
and shake is excellent advice. You have to decide what you do not need to say and then don't say it
and that's the "prune the big limbs" part. The next step is to decide what words you do not need in
your paper, what ideas or concepts you do not need to present in your paper. For this, you need to
build up a good story frame. A broken frame is inefficient. When you present your ideas in
different places in your paper, you always repeat things, which is not very good thing in
scientific writing. When your paper is compact and condensed, then you decide what words you can
get rid of, what words you can do without.

Stephen King gives this advice: "a second draft is first draft minus 10%."This is a great formula
that you should always have in mind when you write and rewrite your paper. You need to decide what
you can get rid of, what words you might delete from your paper.

These are some of the examples of the things that you should avoid in writing: redundancies,
modifiers, adverbs and adjectives, long words, sophisticated words, words that have no meaning or
little meaning, words that do not add any ideas to your content.

### Things to avoid

**Obvious things**  
there is no need to write about things that are obvious or well known. 

**Redundancies**  
Sometimes, we use several words when one word can do all the work that needs doing. As an
example: "`I will develop, test, and apply a new synthetic approach to produce thermosetting
plastics`". Development includes testing and application; and 'synthetic' refers to production; so
the sentence could easily read as "`I will develop a new approach to produce thermosetting
plastics`".

You can avoid redundant words by learning how to ask yourself a very simple question: "as opposed to
what?". For example:

* If you say "invisible to the eye", ask yourself "as opposed to what?" Invisible to the nose?
* "The president's personal doctor". As opposed to what? His impersonal doctor?

**Modifiers, adjectives, and adverbs**  
When you use strong nouns and strong verbs you should not need to modify them (there is no need to
be using many adjectives to modify nouns or adverbs to modify adjectives). When you use strong
nouns and strong verbs, without any modifiers, you will make your writing more powerful, stronger,
and tighter, more condensed.

For example: 

* In the sentence "`the entire reaction sequence takes less than one hour to complete`", the
  word '`entire`' refers to completing the reaction, so it is an unnecessary adjective for the
  noun 'reaction sequence' and you could get rid of it: "`the reaction sequence takes less than one
  hour to complete`". 

* Similarly, you could get rid of '`complete`': "`the entire reaction sequence takes less than one
  hour`". 

* Even further, "`the reaction takes less than one hour`" is probably enough to say the same thing.

**Metadiscourse, discussing the discussion**  
Very often we need to discuss results. We use terms like "we established" or "it has been
established in our study", but we don't always need them. For example, instead of "`in our study we
measured three samples`" you could say "`we measured three samples`".

**Unnecessary long words**  
Whenever a long word and a short word have identical meaning, always prefer the shorter word. This
strategy does not force you to limit your vocabulary to elementary school level but you have to
learn to differentiate whether this or that word is right for your content, or whether it is too
pretentious, and thus, unnecessary. For example: "`start`" instead of "`initiate`"; "`near`"
instead of "`adjacent to`".

## 1.5 Hedging

> "Do not say, the old lady screamed. Bring her and let her scream." — Mark Twain

```

hedge /hej/
noun

* a word or phrase used to allow for additional possibilities or to avoid commitment, for example,
  etc., often, usually, or sometimes.
* limit or qualify (something) by conditions or exceptions.
"experts usually hedge their predictions, just in case"
* avoid making a definite decision, statement, or commitment.
"she hedged around the one question she wanted to ask"

```

The rhetorical conventions of different countries vary greatly. In some cultures, scientists are
expected to make a statement based on expertise, in other cultures, scientists are expected to
hover around the main topic of research.

To hedge—as in the phrase to hedge one's bets—means to take both sides, thus taking no chances of
absolute failure. Hedging is an effective linguistic tool of interaction and cooperation between
people in different spheres of life and science included, but in Anglo-American rhetorical
traditions scientists need to demonstrate that they're confident of their research.

In some cultures hedging represents professional modesty and carefulness; in other cultures it
represents professional purism. But when you present your research, the methods that you
demonstrate and the conclusions that you make must be true in the context (of the study, the
methodology, the particular research, etc.). To show that you're confident of the results and
conclusions you're presenting you must avoid hedging.

From an Anglo-American perspective, when you do not use hedge words, you show that you make a
statement based on expertise. You show that you're confident of your research because if you are
not confident, if you use hedge words, then why should your readers trust your findings if you
yourself are not sure of what you're speaking about.

The English language has a diversity of hedge words (modal verbs, if-clauses, passive constructions,
different modifiers, etc.) and phrases such as "I would like", "I would suggest", "I would
try", "it could be said".

So if you say "this might mean", then you show that you're only 50% sure of what you're writing.

**The subject of the sentence should be clear.**

When you say something like "it is well known", English speaking readers start thinking about
what 'it' is, what stands for 'it'. Does 'it' refer to the research, the method, the finding?
(Where is the subject clarified? In the previous sentence? In the next one?) Just use the real
subject, e.g. `the methodology is well known`. But in this example you might be stating the
obvious—if the methodology is truly well known, you do not need to tell people that it is well
known and you could just mention the methodology, e.g. '`We used the T-test...`'.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 1.6 Fuzzy and Smothered Words

> "Style to be good must be clear, as is proved by the fact that speech which fails to convey a
   plain meaning will fail to do just what speech has to do. It must also be appropriate, avoiding
   both meanness and undue elevation ... Clearness is secured by using the words (nouns and verbs
   alike) that are current and ordinary." — Aristotle (Rhetoric, Book III - Chapter 2)

Science writing should be concrete and credible. We use verbs to energize the writing, but some
verbs steal energy. These verbs are called "fuzzy" or "smothered" words. An example: 
"`We evaluated the systems`". You know that something happened. You know that these systems were
 evaluated, but that's all that you know. You do not know how the systems were evaluated.

**The worst place for a fuzzy word is a hypothesis.**

To make a hypothesis compelling, you should not use fuzzy words. Otherwise, your grand proposal or
research paper will not get funded. I [Course Teacher, Elena Bazanova] think that people use fuzzy
words if they're afraid that they might challenge the reader—they are afraid that they can make a
statement and this statement might be wrong, so, they do not take any responsibility for what they
are writing. But if people feel challenged, if readers feel challenged, they are engaged in your
research. Challenging proposals, in most cases, get funded.

Remember that the job of a scientist is not to be always right—and if you are doing cutting edge
work you're not always going to be right. Your job is to be open and honest about uncertainties in
your research, and in your conclusions, and your findings. Fuzzy words are energy thiefs, they
steal energy from the action by telling, rather than showing.

**If you want to kill action, you should use smothered words.**

In English, the term "smothered verb" refers to a verb whose strength is lessened by "`-tion`" or
"`-ment`"—e.g. "to make an" assesment, improvement, translation, conclusion. 

If you say "`we made an assessment of the problem from three different angles`". This sentence is
not energized; it is not active, it is not concrete. You should say "`we assessed the problem from
three different angles`". And instead of saying "`we made a conclusion`" you can say "`we
concluded`". Instead of saying "`to make a presentation`", say "`we presented`".

**Do not convert adjectives into nouns.**

Converting adjectives into a noun can make your writing blurry, unclear, and not energized. 

*Example 1*: Compare using the adjective 'difficult' (as in `baking is difficult`) to using the
 noun 'difficulty' (as in `there is great difficulty in baking`).

*Example 2*:

* `The characteristics of this condition are the oxidation of membrane lipids, the denaturation of
  proteins, and a reduction in growth rates.`

* `This condition is characterized by oxidized membrane lipids, denatured proteins, and reduced
  growth.`

In the first sentence, all the adjectives are nominalized: `oxidation`, `reduction`, `denaturation`,
and `characteristics of`. In contrast, the second sentence makes them all adjectives, and it is
shorter, more powerful, and stronger.

# Week 1, Part 3: Mighty Words

## 1.7 Function and Structure Words

This whole lesson is unclear; and is not included here. 

Content below is from this article:  
https://mappingignorance.org/2013/12/13/jabberwocky-or-the-poetry-of-function-words/

Function words are the hallmark of human language. When people lacking a common language start using
a pidgin to communicate, they drop function words ...

```

pidgin | ˈpɪdʒɪn |
noun [often as modifier]
    a grammatically simplified form of a language, typically English, Dutch, or Portuguese, some
    elements of which are taken from local languages, used for communication between people not
    sharing a common language.

```

*paraphrase*: Function words provide a lot of semantic information, and they also allow us to easily
guess what grammatical categories words belong to (adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.). The grammatical
scaffold set by the recognizable function words allows us to make sense of the propositional
structure of a text ...

If one knows what to look for, there are a number of telltale signs for function words in the speech
stream: Function words alternate with content words; in English, for instance, nouns are usually
preceded by determiners like a, the, some etc., and verbs are often preceded by auxiliaries or
followed by suffixes like –ing, –ed. Function words tend to be shorter and unstressed. Function
words are a small set of word types, but each generally occurs highly frequently. This contrasts
with content words, which are vast in the number of types but each occurs far less frequently.

## 1.8 'I' and 'We' in Scientific Writing

A great number of researchers whose native language is not English consider the use of first-person
pronouns in research papers inappropriate. Surveys conducted on scientists whose native language is
not English have revealed a serious misconception in relation to first-person pronoun use; all of
the researchers surveyed claimed that the first-person pronoun can not be used in science and that
it is not used in the papers of their field of specialization. In most cultures, the use of first
person pronoun in research articles tends to sound egocentric or pompous.

In 2005, Iliana Martínez carried out a corpus-based empirical study of 1,000,000 words of
experimental research articles published in indexed journals. And her study showed that scientists
whose native language was not English only used personal pronouns in cases that involved little
risk for the writer; they used first-person pronouns only to state a goal or to explain a
procedure. Whereas scientists whose native language is English, use personal pronouns in the
expression of arguments and opinion.

First-person pronouns have a key role in the construction of the writer's persona in research
articles. They show that the writer assumes responsibility for the methodological decisions that
led him or her to the results that were obtained in the research. 

Use of first-person pronouns are a rhetorical strategy, which allows researchers to perform different
discourse functions in the text, through which they construct a convincing argument that persuade
the readers. Expert writers use first-person pronouns to construct their authoritative identities
as knowledgable members of the community. However, do not overuse personal pronouns as they may
reduce the powerful potential of your writing. Remember that the first-person pronouns in research
papers derive their strategic force from the fact that they occur in the background of impersonal
encoding.

A British researcher, Nigel Howard, carried out a quantitative campus wide study of how academic
writers can use first-person pronouns, 'I' and 'we', to help them create a self promotion effect in
their writing. 'I' and 'we' can stress the writer's personal innovations, highlight how
mythological pitfalls were successfully achieved, and to record how the writers were more vigorous
in their quest for sound data that was strictly necessary.
