# Week 3, Part 1: The Road Map

## 3.1 Manuscript Guidelines: Insider Knowledge

All journals publish guidelines or instructions to authors annually in one of their issues. In other
words, there is often more than one correct way of doing something, depending on your intentions.
That is why I advise you to become familiar with details of organization, section headings, methods
of data presentation, and ways of citing and listing references by examining recent papers in any
well-established scientific journal.

**A scientific paper must fulfill at least two objectives**:

1. It must accurately describe the procedures that were followed and the results that were obtained

2. It must place these results in perspective by relating them to the existing state of knowledge
and by interpreting their significance for future study

**Six things that scientific papers do**

In general, there are six things that all scientific papers should do:

1. Trace the scientific origin(s) of the research problem

2. Summarize the state of knowledge on the subject

3. State the critical hypotheses that are tested in the research paper

4. Interpret the results of the study in relation to the hypotheses and to the general state of
knowledge

5. Identify the scientific questions and procedural weaknesses in the procedure that needed to be
addressed in the future

6. Be concise

### Journal Guidelines

The guidelines of some journals will include specific requirements regarding language. And it's
essential that your writing style follows these instructions very carefully.

The most common specification among many English journals in the use of either English, British
English or American English, and even those journals that allow both kinds of variance, will not
want to see a mixture of British and American spellings in their paper, in the same paper.

Abbreviations are another issue that should be in the focus of your attention when your write your
scientific paper. In most cases, journals give very specific instructions about the abbreviations
that should be introduced. If the journal to which you are submitting your paper offers such
instructions, follow them. 

But even if the guidelines say virtually nothing about using abbreviations, you should remember
effective ways of using abbreviations, which should be observed for at least two important reasons:
first, to maintain conventional standards; second, to ensure that your readers will understand your
abbreviations.

Standard abbreviations can be found in a number of places, such as the American Psychological
Association, APA, AP style and other manuals, and many dictionaries, they also present this
information. They show how to use abbreviations and what abbreviations are considered to be
standard. Some of the important points with such abbreviations is to use the appropriate format of
the abbreviations each and every time. So you have to be consistent with your abbreviations, and do
not use different abbreviations to define one of the same thing. And this is a very good example of
this.

So each time, before you start writing your scientific paper, you should read the instructions to
authors thoroughly and follow them. 

These instructions may answer some of the following questions: 

* Does the journal include more than one category of research article? If so, in what category would
  your article fit?

* what is the maximum length of your article? 

* Does the journal have a template for articles? If so, how can it be accessed? 

* Does the journal post supplementary material online? And again, if it does, how should this
  material be provided?

Then the next question that can arise, in what format should preferences appear, APA, MLA, Chicago
or Harvard? Each time you have to check this information with instructions to authors. Next, in
what electronic format should the paper be prepared?

Should figures and tables be inserted within the text, or should they appear at the end, or be
submitted as separate files? Is there online submission system to use? Underline, highlight, note
keypoints to remember, then consult the instructions to the authors as you prepare the paper.
Follow the instructions from the start, and this will certainly save you a lot of time especially
when by some reason the paper is returned to you and you need to review it and to rewrite.

## 3.2 IMRAD Format

> "This so-called IMRaD structure is not an arbitrary publication format, but rather a direct
   reflection of the process of scientific discovery." — [Edanz][] (English editing company)

IMRaD: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion

Papers that report experimental work are often structured chronologically in five sections:

1. Introduction
2. Materials and methods
3. Results
4. Discussion
5. Conclusion

(2, 3, and 4 make up the paper's body.)

The introduction clarifies the motivation for your work presented and prepares your readers for the
structure of the paper.

Materials and methods provides sufficient detail for other scientists to reproduce the experiments
presented in your paper. In some journals, this information is placed in an appendix because it is
not what most readers want to know first.

The Results and Discussion sections present and discuss the research results. In some articles,
these two sections are put together because readers can seldom make sense of results alone without
accompanying interpretation of the results. They need to be told what the results mean.

This so-called IMRAD structure is not an arbitrary publication format, but a reflection of the
process of your research. Each section in the IMRAD format answers a question:

* Introduction: what problem was studied
* Methods: how the problem was studied
* Results: what the findings are
* Discussion: what the findings mean

IMRAD provides an easy roadmap for editors, reviewers, and readers to follow in reading your paper.

Although the IMRAD format is widely used, it is not the only format for scientific papers. For
example, the methods section appears at the end of papers in some journals; in others there is a
combined results and discussion section; and in papers about research, in which results of the
experiments determine the approach to take, the method and results sections can alternate. In some
papers especially in social sciences a long literary review section may appear beginning of the
paper.

### Four Elements Of A Story

According to Joshua Schimel there are four elements that underline the structure of all stories,
including those that we write in science:

1. Opening: the introductory part. Whom is the story about? Who are the characters? Where does it
take place? What do you need to understand about the situation to follow the story? What is the
larger problem that you are addressing?

2. Challenge: what do the characters need to accomplish? What specific question do you propose to
answer?

3. Action: what happens to address the challenge? In a paper, this describes the work you did.

4. Conclusion: how have the characters and their world changed as a result of your action? This is
your conclusion. (What you did and what you learned.)

Even when the physical sections of your paper follow the IMRAD format, the conceptual structure of
the story generally follows this structure, OCAR. Which means that this format can easily be mapped
onto the IMRAD format.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 3.3 The Introduction

> "The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn't induce the reader to
   proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead." — William Zinsser

The purpose of the introduction, is to supply sufficient background information to allow the reader
to understand and evaluate the results of the present study. The introduction should also provide
the rationale for the present study, above all, you should state, briefly and clearly, your purpose
in writing the paper.

Much of the introduction should be written in the present tense, most cases the present simple or
the present perfect tense. Because you will be referring primarily to your problem and the
establish knowledged relating to this problem.

What should you do in an introduction section?

* introduce the topic
* relate to current knowledge
* indicate the gap
* introduce your work
* state research questions and objectives

Do not keep your reader in suspense. Let your reader follow the development of the evidence. Do not
hold back your more important findings until late in the paper. Basically, the problem with a
surprise ending is that the readers become bored and stop reading long before they get to your most
significant findings.

————————————
<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈ 12 character line (EM Rule —) ≈≈≈≈ -->

The purpose of the introduction is to introduce the research. Thus the first rule, definition of the
problem, is paramount. If the problem is not stated in a reasonable, understandable way, readers
will have no interest in your solution. In the introduction, you should have a hook to gain your
reader's attention. Why did you choose that subject and why is the subject important? And why
should they read about this subject?

The second and the third rules relate to the first. The literature of you [??] and the choice of
method should be presented in such a way that the reader will understand what the problem is, or
what the problem was, and how you tried to solve the problem.

These three rules that lead naturally to the fourth and fifth, the statement of the principal
results, and the conclusions, which should be the climax of the introduction.

In some research areas and journals, scientific papers typically follow only the first three rules.
Thus, **when looking at papers in your target journal as models, see whether the introductions
state their results and conclusions. If they do not, you probably should not do this in your
introduction**.

To be more effective, more efficient, the introduction should address the following questions.

First, why did the author undertake this study? Then, what is the existing state of knowledge of
this topic? And finally, what is the author going to do?

Starting your paper is hard. Avoid weak openers. Do not write, "there is an increasing interest in
this area" or "to date, little attention has been paid to". Another weak opener is the so called
dictionary opener when you lecture your readers. This weak opener, in which the first line provides
a banal definition from a reference book.

### How To Build An Introduction Section

You have at least three choices:

1. Start with a question

2. Start with a general assertion

3. Intrigue your reader by slowly revealing the purpose (but this kind of lead will sometimes cause
a side step)

# Week 3, Part 2: Action & Resolution

## 3.4 Materials and Methods

> "The greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the invention of the method of invention." —
   Alfred North Whitehead.

**There is only one rule for a properly written materials and methods section: enough information 
must be given so that the experiments could be reproduced by a competent colleague.**

In the materials and methods section, you should give the full details of your research. Most of
this section should be written in the past simple tense.

The main purpose of the materials and methods section is to describe the experimental design and
then provide enough detail so that a competent worker can repeat the experiments. Pasteur was
probably the first scientist who found it necessary to describe his experiments in exquisite
detail. Because a reasonably competent worker, or peers, could reproduce Pasteur's experiments, the
principle of reproducibility of experiments became a fundamental tenet.

Other purposes of the materials and methods section include providing information that will let the
readers judge the appropriateness of the experimental methods, and providing information that will
permit assessment of the results.

Peer reviewers and editors usually skip the M&M section as they are more interested in the Results
section? False.

Many readers of your paper will *skip the results section* because they already know, from the
introduction, the general methods that you used, and they probably have no interest in the
experimental detail. Probably, they will not be interested, even in the results section, because
the most important sections of any scientific paper is the introduction and the discussion.

Even if readers skip to the introduction and the discussion, careful writing of the materials and
methods section is critically important because the cornerstone of the scientific method requires
that the results must be reproducible. In this section, you must provide the basis for repetition
of the experiments by others. A peer reviewer will read the section carefully, and if there is
serious doubt the two experiments could be repeated, reviewer will recommend rejection of your
manuscript.

**For materials**, include the exact technical specifications and the quantities and source or
method of preparation. This is paramount because the value of your paper can be damaged if the
results are not reproducible, you must describe materials with great care. Be sure to examine the
instructions to authors of the journals to which you plan to submit your paper because important
specifics are often detailed there. **For methods**, the usual order of presentation is
chronological.

The materials and methods section often has subheadings. To see whether the subheadings would indeed
be suitable, and if so, what types are likely to be appropriate, look at similar papers in your
target journal. Be precise, methods are similar to cookbook recipes. Do not make the common error
of mixing of the results in this section.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 3.5 Results

The results section is where you make your case. The introduction proposed an idea. The methods and
materials section described how you tested this idea. Now you must justify your reasoning with
evidence.

When discussing your main findings you should strive for a concise and logical structure. Present
your most important findings first, then establish the central point, and then elaborate on it. The
results need to be clearly and simply stated because it is results that constitute new knowledge
that you're contributing to the world. You should provide the overall picture without repeating the
experimental details that you previously mentioned in the materials and methods section; then you
should provide the data. This section must be presented with crystal clarity.

**Do not be redundant in this section**. The most common mistake is the repetition in words of what
is already apparent to the reader from examination of the figures and tables. Even worse is the
actual presentation in the text of all or many of the data shown in the tables and figures.

Consider the use of graphic or figure representation of data and the important procedures. **Tables
should be able to stand alone and be completely understandable at a quick glance**. Understanding a
table should not require careful review of the whole manuscript.

**Data presented in figures and tables may not substitute for a verbal summary of the findings. The
text should be understandable by someone who has not seen your figures or tables**. Do not
write "the results are given in figure one". Instead you should write what, in particular, the
reader will see in the table, and then you can write something like "temperature was directly
proportional to metabolic rate (fig. 1)".

**The purpose of the result section is to make a point**: "this is what I found and this is what it
means". Your results section should have a clear message.

Many writers feel shy about contextualizing their findings in the results section. Science is often
romanticized as a flawless system of knowledge building where scientists work together to find the
answers. In reality, this is not always the case. The dissemination of results are straightforward
when the findings are positive. But what happens when you obtain results that support the null
hypothesis or do not fit with the current scientific thinking?

Negative results are often associated with flawed and poorly designed studies, and thus widely
viewed as a negative reflection on the scientist. However, they're a valuable component of
scientific publications, because they force us to critically evaluate and validate our current
thinking and fundamentally move us towards unabridged science. Science is, by its nature, a
collaborative discipline. And one of the principal reasons why we should report negative results is
so that our colleagues do not waste their precious time and resources repeating our findings which
are negative. At the core, it is our duty as scientists to publish all data no matter what the
outcome (because a negative finding is still an important finding), and to have a hypothesis to
explain the finding. If the experiment has been performed to plan, the data has not been
manipulated or pulled out of context, and there is compiled evidence of a negative result, then it
is our duty to provide an explanation as to why we are seeing what we are seeing.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 3.6 Discussion

> "Occasionally, I recognize what I call the squid technique: the author is doubtful about his facts
   and his reasoning and retreats behind a protective cloud of ink" — Doug Savile

Discussion is probably the most difficult section to write, and whether you know it or not, many
papers are rejected by science editors because of faulted discussion. Even though the data of the
paper are valid and compelling, many discussion sections are too long and wordy.

Another reason some discussions are difficult hard to follow is that many authors think that they
must avoid first person. If you mean, "I found that ...", or "We concluded that ...", write so. Try
to avoid wordier, heavier structures, such as "It was found in the current investigation that..",
or "It was concluded that...".

### How To Build A Discussion Section

1. Answer the research question stated in the introduction

2. Support and defend answers with the results obtained

3. Explain:
    *  unexpected findings
    *  conflicting results
    *  discrepancies with other research

4. State limitations of the research

5. State significant findings

6. Establish novelty

7. Announce further research

The introduction and the discussion should function as a pair, at least implicitly. The introduction
should have posed one or more questions, and the discussion section should indicate what the
findings say about the answer.

Be sure that the Discussion answers what the *Introduction* asked. Whereas the content of
the *introduction* usually moves from the general topic to a specific area, the *discussion*, in
most cases, does the reverse.

The main purpose of the discussion is to show the relations among the observed facts.

The discussion is a section that can contain substantial strengths and limitations of the research.

Though some authors feel reluctant to introduce such content, you should not avoid stating the
limitations of your research. Those who read your paper must know what the limitations are so that
they do not waste their precious time trying to repeat the same experiment.

**The discussion should end with a short summary or conclusion regarding the significance of your
work, the significance should be stated**. Otherwise, the reader of the paper will find himself or
herself asking "so what?", after reading your discussion, and this is the worst thing that can
happen to you as the writer of a scientific paper.

# Week 3, Part 3: Elbow Grease

## 3.7 Title, Abstract, Keywords

> "I have the strong impression that scientific communication is being seriously hindered by poor
   quality abstracts, written in jargon-ridden mumbo-jumbo." — Sheila M. McNab

In preparing a title, you should always remember that the title is the first thing that thousands of
readers will read. The title of a paper is a gateway to its content. It's the first thing
potentially the readers of the paper see, before deciding whether to move on to the abstract or the
full text.

In 2011, Sarah Hugget carried out research to find out what makes a title draw in citations. Her
citation analysis of papers according to title characteristics shows, that a high impact paper
should be neither too short or too long:

* Somewhere in between 30 and 40 character, appears to be the sweet spot

* It may also be advisable to avoid question marks and exclamation marks in your title

* Colons and commas do not seem to have a negative impact on subsequent citation

* And even when you think that you have a clever joke, or to work into a title, it probably won't
  help you gain citations.

* While a catchy title can help you get readers to look at your paper, it's not going to turn a bad
  paper into a good one.

Robert Day and Barbara Gastel in their famous book *How to Write and Publish a Scientific
Paper*define a good title as "the fewest possible words that adequately describe the contents of
the paper".

An abstract is a 150 to 200 word condensation of the entire work described in the paper. The
abstract, should briefly describe the questions posted in the paper, the methods used to answer
this question, and the results obtained and certainly the conclusion.

The abstract is of extreme importance as in many cases, this section is what is initially previewed
by readers to determine if the remainder of the paper is worth reading.

This is the authors opportunity to draw the reader into the study to engage the reader into the
study, and get them to read the rest of the paper. The paper should be a self-contained unit
capable of being understood without the benefit of the text.

The abstract should contain at least four sections:

1. The purpose of the study the central question.

2. A brief statement of what was done (the methods)

3. A brief statement of what was found (the results)

4. A brief statement of what was concluded (the discussion)

It is not easy to include all this information in just a few words. Start by writing a summary that
includes whatever you think is important for you to search, for you paper. And then gradually,
prune it down to size, removing unnecessary words that leaves.

In 2011, particle physicists were flabbergasted when they discovered that neutrinos, could
apparently travel faster than light, breaking the universal speed limit proposed by Einstein. Their
proposal was later proven to be an error, but before this mistake was revealed, our physicist
scrambled to account for their mind boggling result. 

A group from, H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory in Bristol, and the Indian Institute of Technology
wonder: "can apparent superluminal neutrino speeds be examined as a quantum weak measurement?" The
abstract bluntly answers the question. "Probably not." That's what they wrote in their abstract.
Just these two words. Probably not. It is usual easiest to write the abstract after completing the
entire paper, as abstract is a kind of afterthought.

Speaking about the keywords, let me say that, they are also very important for your career and for
your publication to be successful. Keywords are used for indexing your paper; they are the label of
your manuscript. It is true that, now, they are less used by journals because you can search for
the whole text. However, when looking for keywords, avoid words with broad meaning and words
already included in the title.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 3.8 Acknowledgements

When writing acknowledgements, two possible ingredients require consideration:

1. You should acknowledge any significant technical help that you received from any individual,
whether in your laboratory or elsewhere. You should acknowledge the source of special equipment and
cultures, or other materials.

2. It is usually the acknowledgements wherein you should acknowledge any outside financial support,
financial assistance, such as grants, contracts, or fellowships. One neither thanks nobody or
everybody.

Example:

> It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to thank the Editors of Acta Materiala for selecting me
  to receive the 2012 Acta Materialia Gold Medal and especially I must thank Professor Thaddeus
  Massalski of Carnegie Mellon University, the Executive Secretary of the Board of Governors of
  Acta Materialia, for attending meeting of the European Materials Research Society in Warsaw,
  Poland, in September 2012, in order to make the formal presentation.
> 
> An award of this type owes much of the careful research and the many contributions from my
  outstanding students and collaborators over the past 40 years. 

As you see, this outstanding researcher thanks not only editor-in-chief of Acta Materialia journal,
but his students and other collaborators as well, those who help him achieve academic success.

Another example:

> This work was supported by a grant from Australian Science Fund project number which is gratefully
  acknowledged. We thank Tippelt and Krenn for X-ray and electron microscopy work, respectively. We
  also acknowledge gratefully a careful review of an anonymous reviewer. In this case, the author
  of the acknowledgements not only thank someone who provided financial support, but also an
  anonymous reviewer for the daunting work that he or she has done or was doing while reviewing the
  paper.

There's one very useful rule that you should follow while comparing your acknowledgement
section: **Avoid the word 'wish'**. If you say something like "I wish to thank Mr. Simpson, you're
wasting your words". It may also be introducing the implication that "I wish that I could thank Mr.
Smith for his help, but it wasn't all that significant". So instead of writing this wordy, heavy,
meaningless phrase, you should write, "I thank Mr. Simpson", and that's it.

Before mentioning someone in an acknowledgement section, you should always obtain permission from
him or her.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 3.9 References

There are some common rules to follow in the reference section:

* You should list only significant, published references

* Make sure that all the parts of the reference are accurate

* Make sure that all the references cited in the text are indeed in the literature cited, and that
  all the references listed in the literature their indeed cited somewhere in the text

In the electronic era, it has become much easier to check that every reference is correct. Common
word processing programs include such features as creating, numbering and formatting references,
footnotes and end-notes. These features can aid in citing references and developing your own
reference list. Before you use such programs, however, check the journal's instructions to authors
because some journals say not to use them.

Here is a list of some citation management programs that you can use.

* EndNote
* Reference Manager
* Refworks

These programs let researchers develop a database of references, and use it to create reference
lists in the format of many journals. Accurate citation is part of being a rigorous researcher.

————————————
<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈ 12 character line (EM Rule —) ≈≈≈≈ -->

These are some useful rules that you should follow while preparing your reference list and using
some intext references.

* Cite work from the journal to which the paper will be submitted, this is crucial
* Include many papers from the domain within the past three years
* Cite papers that people in that domain see as important and cite often themselves
* Never cite what you have not read, how many references there should be in the paper?

Sometime back, *Reis and Stiller* and their work showed that the number of references in one leading
journal had increased 300% over a few decades. More recently other researchers sampled a broader
number of journals and expressed alarm at the trend for massive reference lists. Thus, for example,
in a famous paper written by *Brehm and Cole*, there are no citations, nothing was cited. But the
paper itself is fundamental in the discipline.

Your references convey your sensitivity as researcher and connect readers to your work. Unless the
journal imposes a limit, do not worry about having too many references because this is a current
trend.

What about self citation, what about citing yourself? Roughly, 10 to 20% of citations, are
self-citations. Depending on the discipline, though, and the author, some researchers self-cite
because they think self-citations are good for their self-esteem by means of self-enhancement and
self promotion.

Beyond the practical reasons why self-citation is inevitable, there are good rhetorical reasons to
cite your own work. Highland argues that talking about your own work builds disciplinarity and
authority, by citing your own work you convey: "I'm part of this scholarly community, scholarly
conversation and I've done this before. But new readers do similar research themselves, and if they
took time to read one of your papers, they will want to know what else you have published in this
same area. So self-citation describes what you've done and saves your readers time tracking down
your other papers; do not be shy about citing your own work.
