# Week 4, Part 1: Rules of Thumb

## 4.1 Self Editing Checklist

> "Many editors see themselves as gifted sculptors, attempting to turn a block of marble into a
   lovely statue, and writers as crude chisels. In actual fact, the writers are the statues, and
   the editors are pigeons." — Doug Robarcheck (Charlotte Observer Columnist)

Before submitting your manuscript to the journal of your choice, self-edit your paper. To be sure
that your paper is ready for the submission, go through the checklist.

### 1. Figures and tables

Check the figures and the tables. Remember, that a figure is worth a thousand words.

In a table, the contextual material appears on the left and results appear on the right:

| **contextual material** | **results** |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|
|            0            |      25     |
|            3            |      27     |
|            6            |      29     |
|            9            |      31     |
|            12           |      32     |
|            15           |      32     |

If the two sides of this simple table are reversed, it becomes much harder to read:

| **results** | **contextual material** |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------:|
|      25     |            0            |
|      27     |            3            |
|      29     |            6            |
|      31     |            9            |
|      32     |            12           |
|      32     |            15           |

Since in European languages, we read from left to right, we prefer to have the context on the left.

**How do we decide between presenting your data as tables or figures?**

Tables give the actual experimental results. Figures are often used for comparisons of experimental
results with those of the previous works (or with calculated or theoretical values). The way you
present your data is your choice; but remember:

* no illustrations should repeat the information described elsewhere in the paper
* figure and table legends must be self explanatory and clear
* avoid crowded plots using only three or four datasets per figure as well as selected scales
* think about appropriate axis-label size
* include clear symbols and datasets that are easy to distinguish
* never include long boring tables (include them as supplementary material)
* use fonts that are appropriate for the journal and do not become illegible to readers

### 2. Materials and Methods

This section responds to the question of how the problem was studied. If your paper is proposing a
new method, you need to include detailed information so a competent reader or a competent
researcher can reproduce the experiment. 

* Do not repeat the details of established methods
    - use references and supporting material to indicate the previously published procedures
      (broad summaries or key references are sufficient)
* Use standard symbols for numbers
* List methods in the same order that will appear in the results section, in the logical order in
  which you did your research
* Include the descriptions of the surveys or experiments done, the laboratory methods, including
  separation or treatment of samples, analytical and statistical methods
* Avoid additional comments, results, and discussions

### 3. Results

The result section responds to the question "what have you found?". Hence, any representative result
from your research should be presented in this section. The results presented should only be those
that are essential for discussion. (Remember that most journals offer the possibility of adding
supplementary materials; this is where data of secondary importance should go.)

An important issue is that **you must not include references in this section**; you're presenting
your own results so you should not refer to the results of other researchers in this section.

### 4. Discussion

Make the discussion correspond to the results, but do not reiterate the results.

Here, you need to compare the published results by your colleagues with yours using some of the
references included in the introduction. Never ignore work in disagreement with yours; you must
confront it. You must convince the reader that you are correct—that your results, or your findings,
or your observations, or your interpretations are correct or better than theirs.

### 5. Conclusion

This section shows how the work advances the field from the present state of knowledge. In some
journals, it is a separate section; in others, it is a paragraph of the discussion section. A
common error in this section is repeating the abstract or just listing experimental result; never
do this.

### 6. Introduction

* Never use more words than necessary; be clear, concise, and direct
* The introduction must be organized from general background to specificities about your research
* State the purpose of your paper and research strategy adopted to answer the questions; but do not
  mix introduction with results, discussion, or conclusion
* Hypothesis and objectives must be clearly stated at the end of the introduction
* Expressions such as 'novel', 'first time', 'first ever', or 'paradigm changing', are best avoided

### 7. Abstract

The abstract:

* provides a short description of the perspective and the purpose of your paper
* gives key results
* minimizes experimental details
* must be accurate using the words that convey the precise meaning of your research
* offers a short description of the interpretation or conclusion in the last sentence of your
  abstract.

### 8. Title

The title must explain what the paper is broadly about. It is your first, and probably only
opportunity to attract the readers attention.

### 9. Keywords

Keywords are used for indexing your paper. When looking for keywords, avoid words with a broad
meaning, words that already included in the title of your paper.

### 10. Acknowledgements

Thank people who have contributed to the manuscript.

### 11. References

You must cite all the scientific publications on which your work is based. Avoid excessive
self-citations and excessive citations of publications from the same region. Finally, check
spelling of author's names, year of publication, uses of *et al*, punctuation, and whether all the
references are included. 

Now your manuscript is ready for submission


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 4.2 Manuscript Submission

> "The first essential is to know what one wishes to say, the second is to decide to whom one wishes
   to say it" — Harold Nicolson

Before submitting your manuscript, review the instructions to authors from the journal. 

[Usually?] Follow these rules:

* Double space, use margins of at least one inch (that's approximately 25 millimeters)
* Left-justify the text and leave a ragged right margin
* Start each section of the manuscript on a new page
* The title and the author's name and the addresses are usually on the front page
* The abstract is on the second page
* The introduction starts on the third page, and each succeeding section, materials, results, etc.,
  starts on a fresh page

Grammar-checking and spell-checking functions can help but should not be relied on too heavily.
Spell checkers recognize some definite misspellings but not those typographical errors that result
in an existing word but not the one you wanted to use. Thus, proofreading is necessary. In addition
to proofreading the manuscript yourself, try to have someone do so. Consider also reading the
manuscript aloud, it helps a lot, as doing so can help notice the errors.

Almost all journals these days require that manuscript be submitted online. (Few journals ask
authors to submit manuscripts as email attachments.) The electronic submission process benefits
authors as it speeds the publication, and also online submission can allow authors to check the
progress of their papers towards publication.

You should always submit your manuscript with a cover letter. Manuscripts without cover letters
encounter immediate problems.

To which journal is the manuscript being sent? If there are several authors, which one should be
considered as the corresponding author, at which electronic address?

Include in the cover letter:

* current address
* number or fax, and email address
* name of the appropriate editor. (It is often helpful to suggest the appropriate editor because in
  some journals there might be many editors, it can be a multi-editor journal.)
* name of possible reviewers of your manuscript
* the section of the journal that the paper is intended to
* the category of the article that is being submitted


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 4.3 The Road To Calvary

After submitting your manuscript you start waiting for the editor's action letter. An action letter
from the editor has two parts: remarks and comments.

There can be three scenarios:

* Your paper will be accepted
* Your paper will be rejected
* You will be offered a chance to revise and resubmit your manuscript

The journals' management portal may be easier to interpret than the editor's own letter. If you log
into the system and look at your paper, you'll probably see a label for the decisions such
as "accept", "accept pending", "minor changes", "revise and submit", and "reject". If your paper is
flat-out rejected you only have two options, either to throw away your manuscript or submit it to a
different journal.

Submitting your paper to another journal is basically like a first time submission; and if you
followed my advice on journal analysis, you probably already know where else to send your
manuscript. Before sending it again, make any changes that seem worthwhile. A set of reviews, is
free writing advice from scholars in your own field.

Be constructive about accepting feedback. Reviewers usually have a very good, a lot of very good
ideas and you shouldn't let peevishness interfere with improving your work. Learn from the reviews.
Revise your paper and send it elsewhere else. Rejection is not fatal. Rejection is an impetus for
action. <!-- peevish: having or showing an irritable disposition -->

Paul Silvia, author of *How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing*
says: "If you submit 10 papers a year and wait a few days to act on reviews, you have lost 30 days,
a full month of the year". His advice is that, when you get reviews, you should read them
immediately and act on them within two days. This means that revising your paper quickly while the
enthusiasm of the editor is still high and the paper's appeal is fresh. Besides, a fast
resubmission is a mark of a committed researcher with good writing habits.

In online journal portals most revisions have a deadline—usually two or three months, before the
link to submit disappears. While revising your manuscript be constructive. Being constructive does
not always mean accepting all the reviewers' suggestions; it means dealing with the reviews in good
faith. Being open to making major changes to your manuscript, and presuming that the peer reviewing
process makes most papers only better.

Your first step in reviewing your manuscript is to go through the editorial letter, line by line, to
identify action items, comments that require a decision on your part and a response in your
resubmission letter. Editorial letters consist of valuable suggestions for ways to change the
paper, things to add or delete or to reword, rethink or reanalyze.

Minor changes can involve expanding the details in one of the sections, clarifying some statements
and adding references, or deleting a few paragraphs. Major changes can involve recasting the
conceptual basis for the research, adding new data, or converting a long manuscript into a short
report.

But what if editors and reviewers conflict? If the editor conflicts with the reviewers, deal with
the editors suggestion. Sometimes authors simply cannot accept the suggestions made by either the
editor or the reviewer. You have the right to resist, but you should resist in a constructive way.
You should have a good argument. You will need to discuss why you didn't make the changes and you
will need to show that you put a lot of thought into it.

One action that you should avoid, however, is protesting to the editor who rejected your paper. When
you resubmit your manuscript to a journal, you have to include a letter that describes the changes.
Editors read this resubmission letter to see what changes you have made and to evaluate your
reasoning for suggestions that you resisted. Your letter is more important than your than your
revised manuscript. Mature writers give these letters their best effort because it is the
resubmission letter that can finally persuade the editor that your manuscript is worth getting
published. These submission letters can get really long. It is common to see resubmission letters
that contain over 2000 or 3000 words which can be much longer than the paper itself.

# Week 4, Part 2: Final Thoughts

## 4.4 Ethics

> "Scientists shall recognize that they are responsible for assuring the quality of the specialized
   knowledge and skills that they themselves create, and for using their expert knowledge, skills
   and experience to contribute to the health and welfare of humankind, the safety and security of
   society and the sustainability of the global environment." — Code of Conduct for Scientists,
   Science Council of Japan

Graduate students and all those who embark on a career of a scientist may do well to consult
[*On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research*][link_1]

The most important rules of scientific responsible conduct? Authenticity, accuracy, and
originality.

Ethics in science has increasingly become an important issue, and the advent of digital imaging has
given unethical researchers new ways to falsify their findings. Journal editors have procedures to
detect cases in which such falsification of images seems probable; but the complexity of modern
sciences and the rapid progress in research and development require that up to date information is
available in order to make such rejections possible.

Here are a couple some cases of unethical behavior to keep in mind: 

* Jon Sudbo, a physician and former medical researcher who was exposed as a scientific fraudster in
  2006. Over a period of seven years he fabricated results in the field of oncology which he
  published in leading medical journals. The article that led to his downfall, which was published
  in *The Lancet* was based on 2200 patients Sudbo had fabricated entirely. The editor of *The
  Lancet* described this as the biggest scientific fraud conducted by a single researcher ever.

* In 1989 Martin Fleischmann then one of the world's leading electrochemists, reported that
  electrolysis had produced anomalous heat, excessive heat of a magnitude that asserted would defy
  explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. They further reported measuring small amounts
  of nuclear reaction byproducts, including neutrons and tritium. The small tabletop experiment
  involved electrolysis of hardened water on the surface of Palladium electrode. The reported
  results received wide media attention and raised hopes of a cheap and abundant source of energy.
  Many scientists tried to replicate the experiment with the few details available, but hopes faded
  due to the large number of negative replications and the withdrawal of many reported positive
  replications. The discovery of flaws and sources of experimental error in the original experiment
  and finally it was revealed that there was no discovery at all. And by 1989 most scientist
  considered cold fusion claims dead.

The findings in a scientific paper must be new. Except in rare and highly specialized circumstances,
they cannot be appeared elsewhere in the primary literature. If a paper is republished in another
language, the original article must be clearly cited. To republish a paper, permission must be
obtained from the journal the original paper was first published. Beginning scientists sometimes
wonder if they can submit the same manuscript to two or more journals, simultaneously.
Unfortunately not.

Your paper must be original and originality also means avoiding salami science. That is thinly
slicing the findings of a research paper instead of writing just one major publication. Good
scientists respect the integrity of their research and do not divide it excessively for
publication.

Good scientists build on each other's work. If your paper includes information or ideas that are not
your own ideas, be sure to cite the sources, otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism. And this
is, another indication of your scientific integrity, credit.

If your research involves human subjects or animals, the journal to which you are submitting the
manuscript will require documentation that human subjects and animals were treated ethically. So,
before starting your research, be sure to obtain all needed permissions relating to human and
animal research. Authors of scientific papers sometimes have conflict of interest, that is outside
involvement that could interfere with their objectivity in their research that they are doing.
Ethics require honesty, reporting of conflicts of interest. So all in all, these things, you should
always keep in mind that your research should be original, it should be accurate and you should
follow the rules of ethical scientific conduct.

## 4.5 Self Promotion

<!-- % @@@ Continue here --------------------------------------- -->

> "In most, if not all, scientific careers, success is wrapped up in people knowing who we are, in
   getting our name out and infiltrating the circles that can help us reach that next goal." — A
   quote from a science blog

Last year, a survey by Nature found that 50 of researchers have a professional presence online and
37 of scientists visit Twitter daily. Scientists believe that following key figures and publishers
and organizations in their field sharing relevant content and weighing in on points of discussion
is a great way to build bridges. Social media is really good for reaching networks of like-minded
scientists, building research collaborations, and even making friends. But it's not only Twitter
that researchers use to get the word about their research out. As well as a personal website to
update, there are other professional profiles on ResearchGate and Mendeley.

Scientists and researchers see ResearchGate, in particular, as really useful for other researchers
to find their papers and vice versa. So they use the social media to make friends, to collaborate
and to make their research known to their global, international community. In fact, the results
from the present survey carried out by Nature show that 37 of researchers regularly share their own
work on ResearchGate and 39 on academia.edu. And this number is constantly growing.

ResearchGate say that 10,000 new researches arrive everyday. So being stretched for time is clearly
a problem for many researchers. Almost 50 of Nature respondents said that they should probably be
doing more to promote their work in social media if they had substantial time for this.

It is definitely worth to get your research outcomes known to a wider audience. There are a lot of
sources out there to get you started. So Nature Publishing Group and Palgrave Macmillan provide an
authored team's page that's full of useful advice that you can get access to, if you need this kind
of advice.

Social media may even bring about a good opportunity that might have otherwise been missed. For
scientists, it can lead to research collaborations and even grants. In addition, you can make use
of Naturejobs, which is the world's leading dedicated science jobs board. The Nature boards blog
aims to be the leading online resource for scientists in academia and industry who seek guidance in
developing their careers. The blog delivers a mix of expert advice and personal stories to help
readers review, set, and achieve their academic goals. Self-promotion is definitely beneficial when
you want to get your work noticed in your discipline.

More and more researchers send copies to their articles to everyone they cite. They also tell them,
in the cover letter, that they had cited their work and hoped that they might be able to use their
articles in their research. That is, please cite my work. This kind of quid pro quo may seem pretty
tacky to you. Though you should understand the practical nature of this practice in a field where
promotions and newer committees actually want to know how many times a particular article was
cited. And this is not a bad idea just to send the article that has been published to those that
you cited. Just to show them, to thank them again, for the information, for the knowledge that you
obtained from their research, and to indicate that you value their research, you cited their
research, and in return, you explicitly ask them to cite your work. That is how it works.

So what is the purpose of self-promotion? Is it essential to your progression in your career? For
example, making you more visible as an early career scientist to those who might eventually write
letters as part of your tenure evaluation. So what are some other forms of self-promotion in
academia?

One way to become more visible in one's field is to give talks at international conferences. If you
have been publishing and speaking at conferences, but the invitations to visit other universities
are slow to come, you could try to be more active in inviting people to visit your department. This
might make them more likely to reciprocate with an invitation. Or you could express your interest
to a senior colleague who might be able to help spread the word that you give interesting talks and
would be a good person to write. A nice way to self-promotion in fields in which this is possible
is to organize or co-organize a session at the conference. Not a conference, not a gala event, but
just a session at the conference. This seems as professional service. But it also gets you out
there in front of an audience of people of your sub-field and gives you a chance to interact with
co-organizers and speakers. If you pick a broad and interesting topic that involves more than just
your close friends and associates, session organizing can be an effective and very successful way
for self-promotion. So don't shy away from social media, from scientific blogs, from organizing
conferences, try to be as visible as possible. So that probable potential editors or reviewers can
notice you from the very start of your academic career.
