# Week 2, Part 1: Pet Peeves

## 2.1 Wayward Modifiers

> "In literature, the ambition of the novice is to acquire the literary language. The struggle of
   the adept is to get rid of it." — George Bernard Shaw

Modifiers are words and phrases that give more specific information about the words after which they
are used.

The guiding principle for the use of modifiers in English is that the writer should place them next
to the word or phrase that it modifies. Whenever a modifier is not placed where it belongs, the
reader immediately gets confused and frustrated by the meaning of the sentence.

### Three major types of modifier problems

**1. Squinting modifiers**

Squinting modifiers can be hard to define when you're looking over what you've written because,
being the writer of your paper, you know what you mean and you unconsciously assume that what you
have written is correct and anyone is supposed to understand what you have written; but this can be
wrong.

Compare the two sentences below:

* `At our first meeting we agreed to implement the new procedure.`
* `We agreed to implement the new procedure at our first meeting.`

The first one means that, at the first meeting an agreement was made to implement a procedure
(the main idea of the sentence is more related to what happened at a meeting). The second one means
that at some other point in time, an agreement was made to implement a procedure when the first
meeting happens (the main idea of the sentence is more related to the agreement, or to the
implementation, than it is to the meeting).

**2. Misplaced modifiers**

A misplaced modifier is a modifier in the wrong place. Theoretically, at least, the placement
of 'only' may affect writing but, practically, it doesn't matter much.

* `The committee only seemed interested in their proposal. X`
* `The committee seemed interested only in their proposal. ✓`

**3. Dangling Modifier**

A dangling modifier is a modifying phrase, often introductory, with no known present for it to refer
to in a sentence. Therefore, it dangles in a sentence. In some cases it is called hanging modifier.
It is called dangling or hanging because it dangles in the sentence and the noun that it is
supposed to modify is missing.

A dangling modifier is a phrase that modifies a noun that does not appear in the sentence. Dangling
modifiers, in most cases, are considered as grammatical errors.

* *Example 1*: `Turning to Table 4, quite a few differences are found.`

    Here's the solution: put the noun and pronoun immediately after the scripted phrase. If you do
    not do this your reader would be confused and the sentence would sound unnatural and obscure.
    Then the sentence would read: `turning to Table 4, we find several differences`.

    One common question among academic writers when they first encountered dangling pronouns, is how
    to rewrite their sentence with both correct structure and good academic style. And, not
    surprisingly, their concern arises from their fear of using `I` and `we`, as they think that
    these pronouns will diminish the quality of their scholarly writing. But as we already know
    from the previous lesson, these pronouns are a powerful tool to show that you take
    responsibility for your research.

* *Example 2*: `Based on the results, we concluded that the drugs are equally effective.`

    [From http://www.biomedicaleditor.com/grammar-tip-dangling.html]

    'Based on' is an extremely common dangling modifier problem. This phrase appears in almost every
    research paper, yet researchers use this phrase incorrectly. To use this phrase correctly, the
    writer should understand and visualize the concept of something *being based on* something.
   
    (What is based on the results? Implied subject = conclusion; grammatical subject = we)

    - Correction 1: On the basis of the results, we concluded that the drugs are equally effective.
    - Correction 2: We concluded from the results that the drugs are equally effective.
    - Correction 3: Based on the results, our conclusion is that the drugs are equally effective.

## 2.2 Hidden Negation

There are many words with negative meaning, and some of them are not obviously negative.

Take the word 'debatable'. It seems to be a synonym to 'arguable', though the word 'debatable' has a
negative connotation which 'arguable' lacks. And when writer uses this word 'debatable', he or she
expresses his or her disagreement with a statement, and in the same way as the
word 'questionable'.

The words might have a hidden negative meaning: `excessive`, `overstated`, `extreme`, `speculative`,
`at first sight`, `feeble`, `limited`, `hard to accept`

————————————
<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈ 12 character line (EM Rule —) ≈≈≈≈ -->

Avoid negative sentences as affirmative sentences are clearer, more condensed and precise. When
readers encounter negative phrases in writing, first they have to identify the important word and
negate this word. 

For example, instead of "he didn't pass the exam" you should write "he failed the exam".

### Common negatives and their affirmative equivalents

* `Not able ⟶ unable`
* `Not certain ⟶ uncertain`
* `Not clearly ⟶ unclearly`
* `Not many ⟶ few`
* `Not the same as ⟶ different from`
* `Did not ⟶ failed`
* `(We did not achieve the expected results ⟶ We failed to achieve the expected results)`
* `Does not have ⟶ lacks`

**Example**: We change each of following sentences from a negative to a positive

* `The plan did not work  ⟶   The plan failed`
* `This conclusion is not correct  ⟶   This conclusion is not correct`
* `Do not forget to ...   ⟶   Remember to add ...`
* `The solution does not have any modal transaction  ⟶   The solution lacks modal transaction`
* `Not many scientists know what valorisation is   ⟶   Few scientists know what valorisation is`
* `Reducing inflation is not possible if ...  ⟶   Reducing inflation is impossible`

## 2.3 Active vs Passive

> “People often use the passive voice because it's indirect, polite, unaggressive, and admirably
   suited to making thoughts seem as if nobody had personally thought them and deeds seem as if
   nobody had done them, so that nobody need take responsibility. Thus the passive voice is beloved
   of bureaucrats and timid academics.” — Ursula K. Le Guin

Of all the strategies for creating strong, readable, academic writing, every writer should place
pruning and using the active voice at the top.

Use a structure as such: subject, verb, object. This sentence is clear and direct, with its moving
across the page in the same direction as our eyes move while reading.

Converting the passive voice to the active voice calls for the writer to put the true subject first.

* `the experimental data are presented in table 1 X`
* `table 1 presents the experimental data ✓`

# Week 2, Part 2: Sentence Structure

## 2.4 Tenses in Scientific Writing

[Note: I object to the idea of memorizing when a tense should be used. It's something to keep in
mind, and one should look at well-written research papers and try to find commonalities, but I
don't like this lesson. The bullet points are an improvement over the way the material was
presented originally; but still much could be mistranscribed (really the lesson and the way the
teacher spoke was unclear). The bullet points below certainly shouldn't be used to memorize
something like "the past simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a well
known scientist" ... In fact, I would skip this section altogether and find a better, primary
source. I only leave it here as a quick read and something to keep in mind.]

Choosing a tense is not a trivial thing, it is really crucial for an effective scientific writing.

In science writing, there are three basic tenses that are most often used:

* the present simple tense forms 70\% of all the tense forms
* the past simple tense 23\% of all the tense forms
* the present perfect tense about 5\%

The remaining tenses are rarely used in science writing.

Tenses manage time in the research paper. By using a particular tense, you show your reader your
attitude towards your research. Your attitude towards other scientists' research. It demonstrates
whether you regard particular findings as relevant or irrelevant, or whether you just state a past
fact, whether you tell that either what somebody did in the past is the foundation for your
research, but it is not for relevant for the current moment.

*Example*: `"The work demonstrated the use of XPS to characterize the chemistry of materials".`

In this case the past simple tense is used and it demonstrates that the research has been completed
and you are just stating what happened. If you write the same sentence using the present perfect
tense ("`the work *has* demonstrated a new use of XPS to characterize the chemistry of materials`")
you show that the research is still in progress. Or, if it is not in progress, the result of this
research is really relevant for this current moment.

Let's speak about these three tenses in more detail:

The **present simple tense** is used: 

* in the introduction to report what we already know, and to report the topic of the research.
  When you use the present simple tense in the conclusion, then you use it to transmit information
  that has become known
* in the conclusion to say that, now that you know that a fact is relevant, this information is
  crucial
* to make a general statement, conclusion, or interpretation of previous studies or data
  refocusing on what is now known
* to express consent with other authors; we show our agreement with the previous studies.

The **past simple tense** uses verbs in the passive voice, and is used:
* to write about a special study implemented by a well known scientist
* to describe methods and data of the completed study
* in the description of methods and processes
* to demonstrate the details of our experiment, to show that we did something while carrying out the
  experiment

The **present perfect tense** is used:

* to show to your reader that the results of the previous studies to date are relevant
* to summarize the results of studies carried out previously ("`researchers have found`", 
"`studies have suggested`")
* to indicate the connection of the previous studies to those that are currently underway


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 2.5 Punctuation

> "If you aren't interested in punctuation or are afraid of it, you are missing out on a whole kit
   of the most essential, beautiful, elegant tools a writer has to work with."  — Ursula K LeGuin

Punctuation serves a crucial function in English. In writing, punctuation substitutes all the
messages that the spoken word can convey through intonation, gestures, humour, pitch, volume. As a
result of the total rigorous possibility that characterizes writing in English, punctuation is
essential to the process of letting the reader know how one part of your sentence relates to
another.

The absence or presence of a comma in the particular position can not only change the meaning of the
sentence, it can sometimes reverse the meaning. In other words, the absence of a comma tells the
reader that more than one of a certain thing exists in the context of a sentence. Whereas the
presence of a comma in that same place will tell the reader that only one of that thing exists for
that context.

You already know from the previous lesson that the presence or absence of a meaning can show whether
you, as a writer, regard this or that information as a essential or non-essential.

In the defining relative clause that defines the noun that precedes the defining clause
(the information you regard as essential) there should be no comma. The moment you put commas, this
relative clause becomes a non-defining clause. It just conveys information that is nonessential and
it provides some extra information that you as the writer consider less important but interesting
to the reader.

It is advisable to know the purpose of your punctuation, to know what you want to separate from
what. For non-native speakers of English, English punctuation is difficult. And one of the problems
writers can encounter is the difference between the US and the UK punctuation.

In general, US writers use more commas, especially to set off nonessential or interruptive words,
phrases, or clauses than writers in the UK. However, this is not the only difference. Part of the
punctuation problem facing most of the researchers where native language is not English is that
English style manuals differ even within countries.

In North America, well-known style manuals are *New York Times Manual of Style and Usage*, the *AP,
the Associated Press Stylebook* and *The Chicago* (its official title is The Chicago Manual of
Style, The Essential Guide to Writers, Editors and Publishers, the 50th Edition). In the UK, *New
Hart's Rules: The Handbook of Style for Writers and Editors*. 

In addition to style manuals, almost all the dictionaries contain all the major punctuation rules.
However, always following the journal requirements, journal submission requirements. And if you as
journal says, that its style manual is Chicago, you must make certain that the paper you're
planning to submit, that you want to get published in this particular journal will meet all the
requirements concerning the punctuation.

Punctuation is used to create a sense of clarity and stress in a sentence. Use punctuation marks to
structure and organize your writing. In the Internet, you can also find many punctuation checkers
that will help you find any possible punctuation problems in your writing.

## 2.6 A Unit of Composition

Words are to sentences what atoms are to molecules, the basic building blocks that controls
structure and function. If we extend this analogy, paragraphs become cells, the fundamental units
of life.

But how do you make a paragraph a cell, a unit of composition? Paragraphs tell stories, not
surprisingly therefore, a paragraph becomes a unit of composition when it tells a complete short
story with a coherent structure that fits into a larger, more extended piece of writing.

Just as an independent clause should express only one thought, **a paragraph should express one
thought**—not two, not five—just one thought which is clear from the beginning to the end. And you
should introduce each paragraph with a topic sentence (the purpose sentence, the main sentence of
this paragraph) which is developed to the end of this full structure of a paragraph.

And this precision returns us to the philosophy of reading in Anglo-American rhetorical tradition.
Every reader that is educated in this tradition expects to be able to read each paragraph and
mentally digest all the information it presents in one reading.

**If a writer, in any way, makes a paragraph too long, the reader will first be puzzled, and then
  annoyed**.

Because paragraphs tell stories, stories of your research, paragraphs that lack a coherent structure
can seem confusing and pointless.

What constitutes a paragraph? The answer is coherence.

The paragraph must cohere all as one meaningful unit. The coherence determiner is always the topic
sentence. Simply defined, the topic sentence tells the reader what the paragraph will cover. So the
topic sentence makes a point which the rest of the paragraph develops. So the most important
sentence in any article is the first sentence. If it doesn't induce that you are to proceed to the
second sentence, then your article is dead. The reader will be annoyed, confused, and he or she
will stop reading your article.

[Read the paragraph below quickly, it has terrible grammar. Just get the general idea]

A topic sentence which is developed within a paragraph is a classical structure of a paragraph. But
if a paper were written with only this structure, topic sentence which is developed in the
paragraph, reader could just skip along, skip along just reading the first sentence of each
paragraph. Then what's the point of reading the whole article if, being the reader of this article,
I can just read the first sentence of each a paragraph? Then you should vary the structure, but
make sure that each paragraph has a complete structure because it's a unit of composition, and it
has a topic sentence, and the paragraph is not too long, not too short either. Going through the
idea, just identifying what the meaning is or trying to understand what point you're trying to
make. An alternative form of this type of paragraph is to use a more extended LD structure in which
the lead takes three sentences. 

When is a paragraph too long, when not? The answer is complex. How do you know that the paragraph is
long or short? Remember less is more, and so make a paragraph reasonably short. But always consult
the journal where you're planning to submit your paper. So before starting to write your scientific
paper, identify the requirements that this journal has, then follow the instructions.

Try to browse the archive of the articles just to make sure that the paragraphs which you will write
in your paper are as short, or as long, as the paragraphs written in article in the journal, where
you're planning to submit your paper.

Paragraphs that are too long can be problematic, particularly because they tend to emerge and
develop a number of ideas instead of separating them clearly, and therefore can lack logical
interconnection and coherence. Long paragraphs are often associated with complex stories and
interrelated ideas, which is exactly what one wants to see in a scientific paper. But paragraphs
that run on too long and become jumbled can obscure your ideas presented and lose the attention of
readers. So there is those who do not know what material you're presenting, so if you stuck too
many thoughts in one paragraph, then you will definitely lose your reader. By breaking long
paragraphs into shorter ones can solve the problem.

So identify what thought you want to convey, what idea you want to present, and make it a paragraph
starting with the topic sentence. **Coherent paragraphing with clear topic sentences is intrinsic
to Anglo-American rhetoric**. If you're not already in the habit of thinking in English, or writing
in English paragraphs, start now and the practice will do you good.

As you read the articles of the past English-speaking writers in international journals, try to
imitate the idea of a paragraph. Try to write in a similar way. And that's not a bad thing if you
simply count the lines and write your paragraph in exactly the same number of lines as you can see
in the high-ranked international journals.

The key to good writing paragraphs and fixing bad ones is similar to those of other writing problems.

* So you need to identify who and what the story is about.

* Then you decide what point you are presenting and where you should make it.

* Put the critical pieces of information in the right places, and use the rest of the text to tie
  them together smoothly.

Organizing your paper with coherent paragraphs is not enough. You need some transitions. You need to
use structure words to glue the paragraphs together to put them in a logical order, trying to
present information logically, clearly, and in a direct way. So you need to use some very specific
discourse markers indicating a change, a comparison, a contrast, or a focus on a different study or
text or experiment.

Repeat whatever words are necessary at the beginning of a new paragraph to connect it logically with
the succeeding paragraph. So pronouns, it, this, they, should be avoided at the beginning of a
paragraph. Because as you remember, from one of the previous lessons, that they are meaningless.

They carry little or no meaning, so they should be avoided.

# Week 2, Part 3: Internal Structure

## 2.7 Anglo American Style

> "The last thing one knows in constructing a work is what to put first." — Blaise Pascal

Argumentation is a complex subject with may aspects, as well as many angles from which one may view
it. The purpose of this part of the lesson is to help you understand Anglo-American argumentation
in general, so that you can develop your own strategies for constructing the arguments of whatever
type you need for each paper.

As you already know, that Anglo-American rhetorical idea. The idea of what writing is, and how the
writer should organize his or her thinking. And how the writer would present and argue the main
idea is different from other linguistic communities that have a different way of organizing and
presenting ideas. The Anglo-American rhetorical, their idea of writing, is based on Aristotelian
logic. Whereas most European, Russian included, by contrast are more Hegelian. Based on thesis,
anti-thesis and synthesis.

While the Aristotelian logic is based on statement and then the very solid proof. Argument derives
from the Latin 'arguere', which means 'to make clear'. In English, constructing a valid argument
calls for applying Aristotelian logic. A publishable paper in English, must contain sound reasoning
that the writer carefully puts together, with aim of convincing the reader of the rightness of his
or her theory, statement, or position.

Argument then entails a meticulous ordering of the writer's ideas. So that they lead the reader from
the beginning to the end, from abstract to conclusion step by step, to agree with writer's
conclusions. Although it may seem that argumentation plays second fiddle to other aspects of
scholarly writing. A carefully constructed argument is as essential to good writing, to a good
scientific article, as methodology and evidence. Although argumentation of any given paper is
determined after the reasearch is done and after the evidence is collected. It generally begins as
the seed of this research, and develops slowly as the work progresses, and tends to influence the
questions that we're asked and influence the answers that are given in your research paper. And if
you think that research is worth writing, that you probably have a number of different thoughts
that are worth sharing, then you should make sure that the way you present your ideas is logically
constructed and your argumentation is solid.

If you put forward a hypothesis, you should make sure that in your research the reader will find
answers. And you can persuade the reader, providing solid evidence, that your findings, that your
discoveries, they were worth reading about. A basic scholarly argument, involves introducing the
problem or topic by providing background, context, current situation, previous literature, and
experiments, and so on.

You should explain how you have approached the problem by describing and justifying your
methodology. And then report the evidence you have discovered through the methodology. 

### Effective Argumentation

To facilitate effective argumentation, you should always ask yourself some simple questions: 

* Have I explained my thinking clearly and thoroughly enough for readers to understand?
* Have I valued my research and its implications fairly?
* Does the evidence I report, support my conclusions?
* Have I considered all the conclusions that might follow from the evidence?
* Do I make the limitations of the study clear?
* What do my readers need to know?
* What additional information might help convince the reader of the rightness of your position?

### Framing

Framing makes logic out of unconnected sentences. Framing occurs on different levels. 

One is the simple use of transitional adverbs, from 'therefore' to 'however', from 'first' to 'on
the other hand'. From 'we shall soon see', to 'as previous mentioned'. 

Another level is that of letting your reader know what will happen, when this will happen, so that
the writer can make the digression without losing the reader's attention. 'Therefore', 'thus', 
'consequently', and 'hence' have precise meanings and functions related to cause and effect. And
these words are used extensively in any scientific writing. 

But there are some words that you should avoid while trying to persuade, to convince your reader of
your findings. And one of these phrases is 'to my knowledge'. Try not to use this expression
because it indicates that you have not done extensive research; you have not read all of the
literature, and you're not confident of your findings, and your knowledge might be limited.


<!-- ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈***≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈ -->
## 2.8 Presenting Results Or Telling a Story

Writing high quality scientific papers is not that easy because the primary thing that you should
always keep in mind is that you're not simply presenting your results, you're not simply sharing
your findings; you are telling the story of your research.

Somewhere in a mass of data is a story, the story of your research that comes out and your job is to
give this story to your readers. In looking for the story, remember, that when you do science, our
ultimate goal as science writers is not to present the data, but to present the understanding of
those data.

So the role of scientists is to collect the data and to interpret the results, to interpret the
findings, to show the understanding of what you found while carrying out your research. 

There are three aspects of good story telling in science:

First, content, what makes the story engaging and what keeps the reader with you as a science
writer?

The second is structure, how do you put together the content to make it readable, to make it
interesting to the reader and so that the reader can follow the train of your thought?

And third is language, how do you write the story in the most compelling way possible?

Think well, write well, and then think some more while you write.

## 2.9 Journal Analysis

> "I've always been in the right place and time. Of course, I steered myself there." — Bob Hope

Too often authors write scientific articles and then consider where to publish them. However, the
decision is best made early, before the writing begins. That way the paper can be geared
appropriately to the target audience. For example, readers of a general scientific journal of your
disciple as a whole, or a journal in your specialized area. Choosing a journal carefully helps you
reach the most suitable audience in appropriate recognition and avoid needless difficulties with
publication. Before you get down to writing your science paper, you should analyze journals for
elimination and submission. And this is crucial.

You should analyze journals not after you have written your paper but before. Why should you do
this? You should analyze a journal from every possible angle. The audience, the content, focus,
language and, the organization of the paper. Never forget that when the editor receives your paper
it should look exactly the way all the other articles that are published in this journal look. And
your paper should be a near perfect match. From the abstract to the conclusion. From the
organization to the argument. From the section headings. From the sentence structure to the
paragraph structure. From the use of personal pronouns or active or passive, the choice of active
or passive voice.

So before you start writing your paper, analyze journals. Make sure that you know what tense is
preferable, whether personal pronouns are used In this journal, whether the structure of articles
published in this journal, they follow the IMRED format. Introduction, Methodology, Methods,
Results and Discussion.

So make sure that each aspect of your paper is exactly the same that the editor expects from your
research, from your publication. Everything, including labeling the tables and average number of
lines in the paragraph, should look familiar to the editor. So if the paragraphs are short, then
make your paragraph short. If the introduction contains ten lines, then count the lines and make
sure that your introduction is exactly the same size.

Therefore, no strategy for getting published in the international professional journal Is as crucial
as journal analysis. The goal of which is to know how best to organize and write a particular piece
for a specific journal.

Unfortunately, many novice scientists, they first write their paper and only then look for a
prestigious journal to which they are planning to submit their paper. 

**Journal analysis involves two phases**: The first phase is eliminating the journals that are
  inappropriate to either the nature of your paper, or to the level of your academic English
  skills. Make sure that what you're planning to write will fit to the journal, to the articles
  published in this very journal, and that your paper will not annoy the editor the moment he or
  she receives the manuscript. The second phase is analyzing the journal for style, language and
  organization.

For beginning writers, writing a paper without having conducted thorough or proper journal analysis
is largely ineffective because all journals put forward different requirements and you cannot write
a paper which will fit all journals. 

Do not try to write a paper which is one size fits all because there are as many requirements, as
many different strategies for writing your paper, as there are journals. 

So your journal analysis should also contain such factors as assessing the ratio of theory and
practice. And the amount of data you need to present, analyzing the abstract of specific types of
language and determining the overall organization of the paper. The best way to get a feel for how
a scientific paper is organized is by looking at articles in primary journals, top ranked
international journals. 

If you submit a manuscript to a poor choice of journal, one of three things can happen, and all
these things are bad: 

Your manuscript may simply be returned to you with the comment, not suitable for the journal.

Second, if the journal is borderline in relation to your work, your manuscript may receive a poor or
unfair review, because the reviewers of this journal may be only vaguely familiar with your
specialty, with the area of your research and you may be subjected to trauma of rejection.

Third, even if your paper is accepted and published, your joy will be short lived if you later find
