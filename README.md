Notes on writing, language, and grammar

The basis of this material is *copied and pasted* from different sources, but I have arranged,
re-arranged, explained, re-explained, commented, and changed comments to make it easier to
understand. In other words, the contents of the files are either *very different* to the original
material or *essentially the same and don't provide anything new*, depending on how you want to
look at it. Simply put: these are simply my personal notes and they are arranged and edited in a
way that is convenient for me; no claims are made and no guarantees are given.

## Contents

* `analysis_public_speaking_thesis.md` analyses Emily Johnston's Three Minute Thesis University of
  South Australia Grand Final winning presentation

* `big_summary_penguin_punct.md` contains a summary to *The Penguin Guide to Punctuation* by R.L.
  Trask
  
* `linguistic_terminology.md` explains the context and meaning of different terms in linguistics;
  this is "neither a dictionary nor an encyclopedia, but something in between". I can't say that
  I've tried to keep the summary as short as possible, or that it's a "practical" guide; but I've
  certainly tried to build the summary around the terms that I've found are essential to know. The
  value of something like this comes from the *study* of language being akin to algebra: there is
  little room for ambiguity, and the precise definition of several elements and their relationships
  is required to even begin a statement   
  
* `MIPT_Tech_Writ--Week_2.md` introduces the basics of technical writing

* `oxford_abbreviations.md` contains a summary from *New Hart's Rules*/*Oxford Style Manual* on the
  usage `e.g.`, `i.e.`, `viz.`, and `etc.`

* `MIPT_Sch_Com` contains class notes with interesting ideas on clear communication (most notably
  about the differences between the rhetorical styles of native English speaker and non-native
  English speakers)
