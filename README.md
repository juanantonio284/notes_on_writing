Notes on writing, language, and grammar

The basis of this material is *copied and pasted* from different sources, but I have arranged,
re-arranged, explained, re-explained, commented, and changed comments to make it easier to
understand. In other words: the contents of the files are either *very different* to the original
material or *essentially the same and don't provide anything new*, depending on how you want to
look at it. No claims are made and no guarantees are given; these are simply my personal notes and
they are arranged and edited in a way that is convenient for me.
