Notes on writing, language, and grammar

The basis of this material is *copied and pasted* from different sources, but I have arranged,
re-arranged, explained, re-explained, commented, and changed comments to make it easier to
understand. In other words, the contents of the files are either *very different* to the original
material or *essentially the same and don't provide anything new*, depending on how you want to
look at it. Simply put: these are simply my personal notes and they are arranged and edited in a
way that is convenient for me; no claims are made and no guarantees are given.

## Contents

* `MIPT_Sch_Com` (directory) contains notes from the MIPT course on Scholarly Communication that is
  not available online anymore. The course consisted solely of video lectures and had no written
  content. The notes on this repository are made from the video transcripts.

  - The course presents interesting ideas to improve scholarly communication (most notably related
    to the differences between rhetorical styles of native English speakers and non-native English
    speakers). 

* `MIPT_Tech_Writ--Week_2.md` introduces the basics of technical writing

* `analysis_public_speaking_thesis.md` is an analysis of Emily Johnston's *Three Minute Thesis
  University of South Australia Grand Final* winning presentation

* `big_summary_penguin_punct.md` contains a summary to *The Penguin Guide to Punctuation* by R.L.
  Trask
  
* `linguistic_terminology.md` explains the context and meaning of different terms in linguistics;
  this is "neither a dictionary nor an encyclopedia, but something in between". I can't say that
  I've tried to keep the summary as short as possible, or that it's a "practical" guide, but I've
  certainly tried to build the summary around the terms that, over time, I've found are essential
  to know.

* `oxford_abbreviations.md` contains a summary from *New Hart's Rules*/*Oxford Style Manual* on the
  usage `e.g.`, `i.e.`, `viz.`, and `etc.`
