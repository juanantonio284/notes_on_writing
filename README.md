Notes on writing, language, and grammar

The basis of this material is *copied and pasted* from different sources, but I have arranged,
re-arranged, explained, re-explained, commented, and changed comments to make it easier to
understand. In other words: the contents of the files are either *very different* to the original
material or *essentially the same and don't provide anything new*, depending on how you want to
look at it. No claims are made and no guarantees are given; these are simply my personal notes and
they are arranged and edited in a way that is convenient for me.

## Contents

* `big_summary_penguin_punct.md` contains a summary to *The Penguin Guide to Punctuation* by R.L.
  Trask. This summary goes through the whole book and is, unavoidably, quite large. (Trask's work
  is great and worth reading and noting in detail.) [In the future I will upload a small summary
  with just the bullet points.]
  
* `linguistic_terminology.md` explains the context and meaning of different terms in linguistics;
  this is "neither a dictionary nor an encyclopedia, but something in between". And its value comes
  from the *study* of language being much more akin to algebra than to the *usage* of language:
  there is little room for ambiguity, and the precise definition of several elements and their
  relationships is required to even begin a statement. I can't say that I've tried to keep the
  summary as short as possible, or that it's a "practical" guide; but I've certainly tried to build
  the summary around the terms that I've found are essential to know.

* `MIPT_Sch_Com-- ... .md` a great summary of ideas on clear communication (most notably about the
  differences between the rhetorical styles of native English speaker and non-native English
  speakers.)
  
* `MIPT_Tech_Writ--Week_2.md` introduces the basics of technical writing.

* `oxford_abbreviations.md` contains a summary from *New Hart's Rules*/*Oxford Style Manual* on the
  usage `e.g.`, `i.e.`, `viz.`, and `etc.`.
